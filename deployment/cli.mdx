The Novu CLI provides a mechanism for you to synchronize your Workflows into Novu Cloud so that non-technical Novu users can control the Workflow and Step-level controls and enable your Workflows to be triggered via Novu API.

```bash
npx novu@latest sync --bridge-url <YOUR_DEPLOYED_URL> --secret-key <NOVU_SECRET_KEY>
```

- If your application api server is running at URL **https://api.domain.com** and **/api/novu** endpoint is serving Novu workflows created using Novu Framework, then `<YOUR_DEPLOYED_URL>`in above command will be `https://api.domain.com/api/novu`

- If your application is running in local machine with local studion server, then tunnel url can be used as `<YOUR_DEPLOYED_URL>`. Tunnel url is in the format `https://041e553c-0dbf-47e0-8ffa-c4536f390145.novu.sh/api/novu`. Here `041e553c-0dbf-47e0-8ffa-c4536f390145` is the tunnel id which is different for each tunnel started using Novu CLI.
