## Networking

Novu Cloud workers will need to be able to communicate with your [Bridge Endpoint](/concepts/endpoint). You will need to ensure that your firewall rules allow traffic from the internet.
Due to the autoscaling nature of Novu Cloud, we don't have a set of IP Addresses that you can whitelist.

## Security

Novu Cloud workers are GDPR, SOC2 type II and ISO 27001 compliant. We take security very seriously and have implemented a number of security measures to ensure that your data is safe.
Novu Framework has a builtin security mechanism that ensures that the requests are authentic from Novu Cloud using an HMAC signature.

HMAC Verification is turned on by default

```typescript
export const client = new Client({
  secretKey: process.env.NOVU_SECRET_KEY,
  strictAuthentication: process.env.NODE_ENV !== "development", // set to true by default
});
```

<Info>
  For local development with Studio `strictAuthentication` should be set to
  `false`.
</Info>

The `X-Novu-Signature` header included in each signed event contains a timestamp and one or more signatures that we verify.
The timestamp is prefixed by `t=`, and each signature is prefixed by a scheme.
Schemes start with `v`, followed by an integer. Currently, the only valid live signature scheme is v1.

{/* todo add an example of the x-novu-signature header here */}

Handling the signature verification is done by the Novu Framework, so you don't need to perform any action.
