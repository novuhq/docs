A workflow holds the entire flow of steps (nodes) that are sent to the subscriber. This is where all the different channels are tied together under a single entity.

## Structure

A workflow acts as the blueprint for the notifications that will be sent. This is where all the different channels, filters, rules and actions are tied together under a single entity.

The **Workflow Editor** simplifies building automated, personalized workflows without coding while also allowing developers to refine code-based workflows. 

## How it works

Workflow Editor builds on the principle of steps. Instead of defining a single, complex piece of business logic, workflows contain multiple individual steps.

In case of an error, a failed step is retried individually without needing to re-run any previous steps. Instead of the entire business logic, each step can take up your serverless function execution duration, and many more benefits.

Here is how a workflow looks like in the UI Workflow Editor:

## Workflow building blocks

Every Novu workflow is built using these four key elements:

- **Workflow identifier**: A unique ID used to link triggers to the correct workflow
- **Trigger**: The event or action that starts the workflow
- **Channel steps**: These send notifications through your configured channels
- **Action steps**: Functions that manage the workflow’s logic and control its flow

### Workflow identifier

Give your Workflow a clear, descriptive name that your team can easily identify. 
Workflow identifiers should be unique to your application and descriptive of the workflow's purpose.

For example:

- Abandoned cart recovery
- Password reset flow
- New user welcome series
- Re-engagement campaign

### Trigger

A trigger starts every workflow. It’s an action or event that tells the workflow to begin. To do this, you call the Novu API with a unique workflow trigger identifier (`workflow_id`), which links the trigger to the correct workflow.

When the trigger happens, it sends the data the workflow needs to notify subscribers. [Learn more about subscribers](/concepts/subscribers).

Triggers are the only way to start workflows and send notifications, making sure everything runs as expected.

**Example of a trigger**
Here's an example of an API call to trigger an event:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.novu.co/v1/events/trigger \
  -H "Authorization: ApiKey <NOVU_SECRET_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "<WORKFLOW_TRIGGER_IDENTIFIER>",
    "to": {
      "subscriberId": "<UNIQUE_SUBSCRIBER_IDENTIFIER>",
    },
    "payload": {}
  }'
```

### Channel step

A **Channel step** in Novu represents a configured provider to send notifications to your recipients.

The Workflow Editor is designed for **Omni-Channel Communication**, delivering a unified experience across diverse messaging channels:

- **In-app notifications**
- **Email**
- **SMS**
- **Push**
  - **Mobile push**
  - **Web push**
- **Chat**
  - **Enterprise messaging platforms** (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams)
  - **Consumer messaging apps** (e.g., WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord)

Most providers within Novu use credentials that you supply to deliver notifications on your behalf. These credentials and other settings are what make a configured channel. 

### Action steps

**Action steps** are purpose built functions that help manage the workflow flow. **Action Steps** can be executed before and after **Channel steps**. 
For example, you can use a **Delay** to pause a workflow for a certain duration before sending a notification.

There are three types of action steps supported by Novu:

- **[Delay](/workflow/delay)**
- **[Digest](/workflow/digest)**
- **[Custom](/workflow/custom)**

## Execution of workflow steps

When a workflow is triggered, its steps are executed in a predetermined sequence. This ensures a controlled, orderly flow and helps maintain the integrity of the notification process. 
Here's how it works:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step-by-step activation">
    Each step is executed one at a time, in the exact order they are defined. This guarantees that dependencies and prerequisites for later steps are met before moving forward. 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Predictable flow">
    Sequential execution creates a reliable process, ensuring that outputs from earlier steps seamlessly influence subsequent steps.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Orderly messaging">
    Messages are sent in a structured manner, preventing overlap or confusion and ensuring each step receives the attention it requires.
  </Step>
</Steps>

By following this approach, workflows remain consistent, predictable, and effective.
