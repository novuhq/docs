## Integrations

Integrations are what allow Novu to handle message delivery over multiple channels. Of the five notification channels that Novu currently supports, each channel except the ‘in-app’ channel has multiple providers.

### Integraton Store

You can configure your own integrations by visiting the [Integration Store](https://dashboard.novu.co/integrations). 
When connecting the integration you will be asked to provide the `credentials` and other optional configurations for the integration. All secret keys are encrypted before persisted to the database.

### Available Integrations

You can find the list of available integrations for each channel:

### Missing an integration?

If you don't see the integration you need, you can create a custom integration using the [Custom Step](/workflow/custom). Or contribute to the [Novu Integrations Repository](/community/add-a-new-provider).
