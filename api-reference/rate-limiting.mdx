<Note>This feature is available from v0.22.0.</Note>

Rate limiting is an essential functionality for establishing a robust and resilient system. It safeguards system resources from being misused by malicious actors or being monopolized by one client.

A variable-cost token bucket rate limited algorithm has been added to provide the capability for different API controllers and methods to have a varying cost. It also lays a foundation for dynamic costing of resource consumption.

## Limits

The following limits apply to each category of the Novu system. Each category has an independent bucket of request tokens to consume from.
Standard requests cost 1 request token and bulk requests cost 100 request tokens. Both standard and bulk requests consume from the same token pool.

Each category has a different limit of requests per second (RPS), with the endpoints in each category shown below.

| Category      | Free   | Business | Endpoints                                                            |
| ------------- | ------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Events        | 60 RPS | 600 RPS  | Trigger                                                              |
| Configuration | 20 RPS | 200 RPS  | Subscribers, Topics, Tenants                                         |
| Global        | 30 RPS | 300 RPS  | All other endpoints consume request tokens from this category. |

### HTTP response headers

When integrating with Novu API, itâ€™s important to consider the rate limiting HTTP headers included in the response. These headers help you manage your API usage and avoid hitting rate limits. 

```
RateLimit-Remaining: 219
RateLimit-Limit: 300
RateLimit-Reset: 2
RateLimit-Policy: 300;w=5;burst=330;comment="token bucket";category="trigger";cost="bulk";serviceLevel="free"
```

- `RateLimit-Remaining` - Indicates the remaining number of request tokens in the current window.
- `RateLimit-Limit` - Indicates the total number of request tokens available in the current window.
- `RateLimit-Reset` - Indicates the number of seconds until the current window resets and the request token limit is fully replenished.
- `RateLimit-Policy` - Defines the details of the applied rate limiting policy.
- `Retry-After` - Specifies the number of seconds to wait before making another request.
