title: "How Novu Works?"
---

At Novu, weâ€™re redefining how you engage users with notifications. 
Our platform offers the most flexible and customizable set of tools to deliver modern, seamless, and highly personalized notification experiences. 

Whether you're sending alerts, updates, or tailored messages, Novu enables you to design notification flows that adapt to your users' preferences, across any channel, with ease.

Now let's dive into how Novu works.

## API & SDKs

Managing notifications across multiple channels is painful. Each [provider](/concepts/providers) has their own SDK, authentication methods, and API quirks. 

<Warning>
**You'd normally need to:**
- Learn and maintain different codebases for email, SMS, push, and chat providers
- Handle varying API response formats and error patterns
- Keep track of multiple API keys and credentials
- Build abstraction layers to standardize notification logic
- Deal with provider-specific rate limits and quotas
</Warning>

Novu eliminates these headaches with a unified API.<br />
Instead of juggling multiple providers' APIs and SDKs, you get a single, consistent interface to control all your notification flows.

<Check>
**Our API enables you to:**
- Trigger notifications across any channel
- Manage subscriber profiles and preferences
- Power real-time notification feeds with our [full-stack UI Components libraies](/inbox/introduction)
- Handle notification templates and workflows
</Check>

You can integrate Novu in two ways:
1. Use our [server-side SDKs](/sdks/overview) for seamless integration
2. Make direct [HTTP requests](/api-reference/overview) using your environment's API Secret Key

Every request you make is automatically routed to the correct [environment](/concepts/environments), ensuring clean separation between development, and production.


## Workflows

Workflows are the core building blocks of Novu's notification system. They enable you to design sophisticated messaging sequences that can span multiple communication channels like email, SMS, and push notifications. 

Using intuitive logical operators and action steps, you can create dynamic notification paths that automatically adapt based on user preferences and behavior.

Every notification in Novu originates from a workflow trigger, making workflows the central orchestration layer for your entire messaging infrastructure. 

Whether you need to send a simple welcome email or implement a complex multi-step notification sequence with fallbacks and conditional logic, workflows provide the foundation for managing these communications effectively.

![novu-workflows](/getting-started/media-assets/novu-workflow.png)

Your application can trigger workflows using our REST API, any one of our available SDKs. You can use the dropdown menu on the code sample below to look at a sample in your language of choice:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.novu.co/v1/events/trigger \
  -H "Authorization: ApiKey <NOVU_SECRET_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "<WORKFLOW_TRIGGER_IDENTIFIER>",
    "to": {
      "subscriberId": "<UNIQUE_SUBSCRIBER_IDENTIFIER>",
      "email": "john@doemail.com",
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Doe"
    },
    "payload": {
      "name": "Hello World",
      "organization": {
        "logo": "https://happycorp.com/logo.png"
      }
    }
  }'
```

```javascript Node.js
import { Novu } from "@novu/node";

const novu = new Novu("<NOVU_SECRET_KEY>");

await novu.trigger("<WORKFLOW_TRIGGER_IDENTIFIER>", {
  to: {
    subscriberId: "<UNIQUE_SUBSCRIBER_IDENTIFIER>",
    email: "john@doemail.com",
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
  },
  payload: {
    name: "Hello World",
    organization: {
      logo: "https://happycorp.com/logo.png",
    },
  },
});
```

```python Python
from novu.api import EventApi

url = "https://api.novu.co"
api_key = "<NOVU_SECRET_KEY>"

novu = EventApi(url, api_key).trigger(
    name="<WORKFLOW_TRIGGER_IDENTIFIER>",  # This is the Workflow ID. It can be found on the workflow page.
    recipients="<UNIQUE_SUBSCRIBER_IDENTIFIER>", # The subscriber ID can be gotten from the dashboard.
    payload={},  # Your custom Novu payload goes here
)
```

```java Java

        TriggerEventResponse response = novu.triggerEvent(triggerEventRequest);
    }
}
```

```php PHP

{
  EventName = "onboarding",
  To = { SubscriberId = "subscriberId" },
  Payload = onboardingMessage
};

var trigger = await novu.Event.Trigger(payload);
```

</CodeGroup>



Novu processes each workflow run using a combination of the following concepts:

## Subscribers

Subscribers are in most cases users in your application who receive notifications through various channels.

<Info>
**When you trigger workflows for subscribers, Novu maintains a cache of their notification-related data, including:**

- Contact information (email, phone number)
- Profile details (avatar URL)
- Platform-specific tokens (push notifications, webhooks)
- Custom properties (plan type, user role, timezone)
</Info>

Below is a detailed breakdown of the subscriber object:

```json
{
  // Core Identifiers
  "_id": "NOVU_GENERATED_SUBSCRIBER_ID",
  "subscriberId": "subscriberId",
  "id": "NOVU_GENERATED_SUBSCRIBER_ID",
  "_organizationId": "NOVU_GENERATED_ORG_ID",
  "_environmentId": "NOVU_GENERATED_ENV_ID",

  // Basic Information
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@org.com",
  "phone": "+98712345670",
  "avatar": "AVATAR_URL",

  // Custom Data
  "data": {
    "custom_key_1": "custom_value_1",
    "custom_key_2": "custom_value_2"
  },

  // Communication Channels
  "channels": [
    {
      // Firebase Cloud Messaging configuration
      "credentials": {
        "deviceTokens": ["token1", "token2"]
      },
      "_integrationId": "NOVU_GENERATED_INTEGRATION_ID",
      "providerId": "fcm"
    },
    {
      // Discord configuration
      "credentials": {
        "webhookUrl": "URL"
      },
      "_integrationId": "NOVU_GENERATED_INTEGRATION_ID",
      "providerId": "discord"
    }
  ],

  // System Fields

  "__v": 0,
  "isOnline": false,
  "lastOnlineAt": "2022-10-13T17:41:53.238Z"
}
```

## Channels

Novu enables you to configure multiple notification [providers](/concepts/providers) and integrate them into your notification workflows. 
Each [channel](/concepts/channels) represents a configured provider that you can use to deliver notifications in production. 

Here's an overview of our supported channels and providers:

 </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

In Novu's platform, a message is refered to as a [notification](/concepts/notifications) created during a [workflow](/concepts/workflows) run. 

You can design these messages using an intuitive combination of template editor and the Liquid templating language to create dynamic, customizable notification templates.

This unified approach solves two common challenges. 

<Steps>
  <Step title="The need for multiple templating languages">
    Consolidate templating languages into a single system, removing the complexity of managing different syntaxes for different providers. 
    
    This ensures consistency across your communication channels without the need for constant adjustments.
    
    Novuâ€™s built-in engine works seamlessly across email, SMS, push, chat, and in-app notifications. 
    
    Define variables like `{{subscriber.firstName}}` or `{{payload.orderTotal}}` once, and let Novu automatically handle the rest.
    
    **A consistent, efficient workflow across all channels without the need for constant adjustments.**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Notification templates separate from application code">
    Manage notification templates in a dedicated control center, where teams can:
    
    - Edit templates using an intuitive notification template editor
    - Test notifications with real subscriber data to ensure accuracy
    - Switch between channels (email, SMS, push) while keeping content consistent
    - Set up translation variations for different languages
    
    **This separation from your codebase lets non-developers update and manage communications without needing developer intervention.**
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Actions
Each workflow can combine multiple action steps to model complex logic that creates better notification experiences. You can combine the following action steps with any number of channel steps to create personalized notifications for your users:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Digest">
    Digest actions combine multiple notifications into a single, consolidated message. This helps prevent notification fatigue and provides better context for your users.
    
    - Group related notifications within a specified time window
    - Customize aggregation logic and formatting

    [Learn more about Digest action â†’](https://docs.novu.co/workflows/actions/digest)
  </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Delay">
    Delay actions introduce controlled waiting periods between steps in your workflow. This enables better timing and sequencing of notifications.

    - Set precise delay durations (seconds to months)
    - Support for cron-style scheduling

    [Learn more about Delay action â†’](https://docs.novu.co/workflows/actions/delay)
  </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Custom">
    Custom actions allow you to integrate specialized business logic directly into your notification workflows while maintaining workflow durability and state management.

    - Execute arbitrary code within the workflow context
    - Can serve as a trigger for other workflows
    - Pass data from your application's database into the workflow

    [Learn more about Custom action â†’](https://docs.novu.co/workflows/actions/custom)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

In addition to combining channel steps and action steps to create complex workflows, you can augment these steps with additional logic based on the subscriber, inputs from your application, or the status of previous workflow steps.
These are called step conditions.

## Step Conditions
<Info> 
**Coming Soon**
</Info>

Step conditions are powerful rules that determine when channel and action steps execute in your workflow. 

They evaluate trigger data, subscriber properties, and previous step outcomes to create personalized user experiences.

**You can use step conditions to:**

- Skip sending an email if a subscriber has already viewed an in-app message
- Display in-app notifications only to users on specific plans (e.g., `subscriber.data.plan === "pro"`)
- Control timing by executing delay steps based on trigger payload values (e.g., `if delay === true`)

Step conditions automatically respect subscriber communication preferences, including:

- Preferred notification channels (email, SMS, in-app, etc.)
- Preferred times to receive communications
- Frequency and volume settings

## Preferences

In Novu, each workflow run is executed on behalf of a recipient, and each recipient can specify their preferences to receive notifications across a number of different criteria: channel types, individual workflows, and workflow categories.

![preferences](/getting-started/media-assets/preferences.png)

Application developers have control over how these preference sets are presented to the user and which options to surface, but Novu enforces these preferences during every workflow run automatically.

You can learn more about how to set a user's preferences in our [preferences overview](/docs/preferences/overview).

## Dashboard

The Dashboard is a user interface dedicated to managing the workflows, connecting integrations, debugging workflow execution, and more.
The dashboard experience can be optionally extended using the [Novu Framework SDK](/sdks/framework/typescript/overview).

## UI Components

Novu offers a set of full-stack components that can be embedded in your application to allow users to manage their notification preferences, view notification history, and more.

## Framework

<Tip>
Novu can run without a bridge endpoint, but was built to be extended to support any use case.
</Tip>

The bridge endpoint is an HTTP endpoint that is powered by the [Novu Framework SDK](/sdks/framework/typescript/overview) and should be [deployed](/deployment/syncing) in your own infrastructure. 
The endpoint is responsible for extending and customizing the notification platform with more complex logic, such as:

- Automating workflow creation with code powered by GitOps
- Creating custom components for email and other channels
- Abstracting away advanced logic by custom Dashboard controls.
- Executing advanced logic such as:
  - Fetching data from external APIs
  - Hydrating just-in-time subscriber and topic information
  - Decision making for delivery based on custom rules

### Keep learning

While the workflow engine is at the heart of Novu, our goal is to build a complete notification system for our customers. Here is an overview of some of the more-advanced features that we provide:

**UI components**

Novu provides developers with React components like `<NotificationFeed/>` and `<SlackAuthButton/>` to use in their applications. You can read more about building in-app UI with Novu for both web and mobile here.

**Advanced concepts**

There is a lot more to learn about Novu, and our concepts overview page is a good place to start. Here are use cases our customers commonly solve with Novu:

    Powering translation and localization and managing timezone-aware delivery
    Creating advanced notification logic using subscriptions and schedules
    Integrating Novu with your application's data model, using tenants and objects to power customized experiences
    Using the template editor to standarize messaging templates across providers

**Developer tools**

Novu is a developer-first platform, with both environment and commit models. If you want to work with Novu resources in code, you can use our Management API or CLI.

Once you're sending notifications through Novu, we offer observability tools like workflow run logs (to examine all steps of workflow execution in your dashboard) and data streaming into a monitoring system like Datadog with extensions.
