Novu comprises two fundamental components: an API for data exchange and a dashboard for designing notifications and their accompanying logical rules.

This section provides a broad overview of Novu's functionality, delving into key concepts for your initial Novu journey. If you prefer to dive into development, explore our **[Quick Start guides](/quickstarts/overview)**.

## Architecture

Novu's Object Communication Layer (OCL) is a structured framework that separates communication tasks into specialized components. 
Similar to microservices, these components handle specific roles like message passing and data management. By doing so, OCL enhances system maintenance and scalability, making it easier to integrate new functionalities. 

Novu's approach goes beyond this, optimizing communication protocols for seamless collaboration and adaptability. It's like providing a playbook for coordinating a dynamic game, ensuring all players are synchronized for any challenge.
