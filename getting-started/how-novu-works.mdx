title: "How Novu Works?"
---

At Novu, we’re redefining how you engage users with notifications. 
Our platform offers the most flexible and customizable set of tools to deliver modern, seamless, and highly personalized notification experiences. 

Whether you're sending alerts, updates, or tailored messages, Novu enables you to design notification flows that adapt to your users' preferences, across any channel, with ease.

Now let's dive into how Novu works.

## API & SDKs

Managing notifications across multiple channels is painful. Each [provider](/concepts/providers) has their own SDK, authentication methods, and API quirks. 

<Warning>
**You'd normally need to:**
- Learn and maintain different codebases for email, SMS, push, and chat providers
- Handle varying API response formats and error patterns
- Keep track of multiple API keys and credentials
- Build abstraction layers to standardize notification logic
- Deal with provider-specific rate limits and quotas
</Warning>

Novu eliminates these headaches with a unified API.<br />
Instead of juggling multiple providers' APIs and SDKs, you get a single, consistent interface to control all your notification flows.

<Check>
**Our API enables you to:**
- Trigger notifications across any channel
- Manage subscriber profiles and preferences
- Power real-time notification feeds with our [full-stack UI Components libraies](/inbox/introduction)
- Handle notification templates and workflows
</Check>

You can integrate Novu in two ways:
1. Use our [server-side SDKs](/sdks/overview) for seamless integration
2. Make direct [HTTP requests](/api-reference/overview) using your environment's API Secret Key

Every request you make is automatically routed to the correct [environment](/concepts/environments), ensuring clean separation between development, and production.


## Workflows

Workflows are a foundational concept in Novu. They allow you to easily model complex messaging flows across channels using a variety of logical function steps while respecting a user’s individual preferences. All Novu notifications are sent by triggering a workflow.

![novu-workflows](/getting-started/media-assets/novu-workflow.png)

Your application can trigger workflows using our REST API, any one of our available SDKs. You can use the dropdown menu on the code sample below to look at a sample in your language of choice:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.novu.co/v1/events/trigger \
  -H "Authorization: ApiKey <NOVU_SECRET_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "<WORKFLOW_TRIGGER_IDENTIFIER>",
    "to": {
      "subscriberId": "<UNIQUE_SUBSCRIBER_IDENTIFIER>",
      "email": "john@doemail.com",
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Doe"
    },
    "payload": {
      "name": "Hello World",
      "organization": {
        "logo": "https://happycorp.com/logo.png"
      }
    }
  }'
```

```javascript Node.js
import { Novu } from "@novu/node";

const novu = new Novu("<NOVU_SECRET_KEY>");

await novu.trigger("<WORKFLOW_TRIGGER_IDENTIFIER>", {
  to: {
    subscriberId: "<UNIQUE_SUBSCRIBER_IDENTIFIER>",
    email: "john@doemail.com",
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
  },
  payload: {
    name: "Hello World",
    organization: {
      logo: "https://happycorp.com/logo.png",
    },
  },
});
```

```python Python
from novu.api import EventApi

url = "https://api.novu.co"
api_key = "<NOVU_SECRET_KEY>"

novu = EventApi(url, api_key).trigger(
    name="<WORKFLOW_TRIGGER_IDENTIFIER>",  # This is the Workflow ID. It can be found on the workflow page.
    recipients="<UNIQUE_SUBSCRIBER_IDENTIFIER>", # The subscriber ID can be gotten from the dashboard.
    payload={},  # Your custom Novu payload goes here
)
```

```java Java
import co.novu.common.base.Novu;
import co.novu.api.common.SubscriberRequest;
import co.novu.api.events.requests.TriggerEventRequest;
import co.novu.api.events.responses.TriggerEventResponse;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String apiKey = "<NOVU_SECRET_KEY>";

        Novu novu = new Novu(apiKey);

        SubscriberRequest subscriberRequest = new SubscriberRequest();
        subscriberRequest.setEmail("<EMAIL_ADDRESS>");
        subscriberRequest.setFirstName("<FIRST_NAME>");
        subscriberRequest.setLastName("<LAST_NAME>");
        subscriberRequest.setPhone("<PHONE_NUMBER>");
        subscriberRequest.setAvatar("<AVATAR>");
        subscriberRequest.setSubscriberId("<SUBSCRIBER_ID>");

        TriggerEventRequest triggerEventRequest = new TriggerEventRequest();
        triggerEventRequest.setName("<NAME>");
        triggerEventRequest.setTo(subscriberRequest);
        triggerEventRequest.setPayload(Collections.singletonMap("<CUSTOM_VARIABLE_NAME>", "<CUSTOM_VARIABLE_VALUE>"));

        TriggerEventResponse response = novu.triggerEvent(triggerEventRequest);
    }
}
```

```php PHP
use Novu\SDK\Novu;

$novu = new Novu(<NOVU_SECRET_KEY>);

$novu->triggerEvent([
    'name' => '<WORKFLOW_TRIGGER_IDENTIFIER>',
    'payload' => ['customVariables' => 'Hello'],
    'to' => [
        'subscriberId' => '<UNIQUE_SUBSCRIBER_IDENTIFIER>',
        'phone' => '07983882186'
    ]
])->toArray();
```

```ruby Ruby

	resp, err := novuClient.EventApi.Trigger(ctx, eventId, data)

	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal("novu error", err.Error())
		return
	}
}
```

{
  EventName = "onboarding",
  To = { SubscriberId = "subscriberId" },
  Payload = onboardingMessage
};

var trigger = await novu.Event.Trigger(payload);
```

</CodeGroup>

Novu processes each workflow run using a combination of the following concepts:

## Subscribers

Subscribers are in most cases users in your application. As you trigger workflows for subscribers, Novu creates a cache of the data needed to notify them on different platforms, like an email address, phone number, avatar URL, or push token. Novu also stores custom properties you pass from your application to customize their notifications, like a plan type, user role, or timezone.

```json An object used to create a User
{
  "_id": "NOVU_GENERATED_SUBSCRIBER_ID",
  "_organizationId": "NOVU_GENERATED_ORG_ID",
  "_environmentId": "NOVU_GENERATED_ENV_ID",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "subscriberId": "subscriberId",
  "email": "[john.doe@org.com](mailto:john.doe@org.com)",
  "phone": "+98712345670"
  "data": {
    "custome_key_1" : "custom_value_1",
    "custome_key_2" : "custom_value_2"
  }
  "channels": [
  {
    "credentials": {
      "deviceTokens": [
        "token1",
        "token2"
      ]
    },
    "_integrationId": "NOVU_GENERATED_INTEGRATION_ID",
    "providerId": "fcm"
  },
  {
    "credentials": {
      "webhookUrl": "URL"
    },
    "_integrationId": "NOVU_GENERATED_INTEGRATION_ID",
    "providerId": "discord"
  }
  ],
  "deleted": false,
  "createdAt": "2022-10-13T17:40:53.231Z",
  "updatedAt": "2022-10-13T17:41:53.238Z",
  "__v": 0,
  "isOnline": false,
  "lastOnlineAt": "2022-10-13T17:41:53.238Z",
  "avatar": "AVATAR_URL",
  "id": "NOVU_GENERATED_SUBSCRIBER_ID"
}

```

## Channels

Channels in Novu represent a specific provider you have configured to send notifications. You can include channel steps in your workflows to send notifications with the providers you already use in production. Novu supports the following channel types and providers:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Email">
    Novu supports sending email with AWS SES, Mailersend, Mailgun, Mailjet, Mailtrap, Mandrill, Postmark, Resend, Sendgrid, SMTP, and Sparkpost.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="SMS">
    Novu supports sending SMS with Africa's Talking, AWS SNS, Mailersend, MessageBird, Plivo, Sinch, Telnyx, Twilio, and Vonage.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Push">
    Novu supports sending push messages with Apple Push Notification Service (iOS), Expo (React Native), and Firebase Cloud Messaging (Android).
  </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Chat">
    Novu supports sending chat messages with Slack, Discord, Microsoft Teams, WhatsApp, Telegram.
  </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="In-app">
    Novu provides a real-time in-app feed API for receiving notifications, along with drop-in components to display them to your users.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

A notification that is generated as a part of a workflow is called a Message, and Novu allows you to define dynamic message templates using a combination of a drag-and-drop editor and the Liquid templating language.

This helps product and marketing teams standardize on one templating system instead of using different templating languages for different providers. It also has the added benefit of lifting these messages out of your codebase so you can iterate quickly on customer communications without a developer.

## Actions
Each workflow can combine multiple action steps to model complex logic that creates better notification experiences. You can combine the following action steps with any number of channel steps to create personalized notifications for your users:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Digest">
    A digest step condenses multiple activities into one notification, e.g. batch all of the comments on this document for one hour and then send one email with all of the activities.
  </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Delay">
    A delay step waits for a specified duration before proceeding to the next step in a workflow, e.g. send the new user a follow-up email ten days after they sign up.
  </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Custom">
    The Custom action step lets you to execute custom logic and maintain its state within the durable execution context of a workflow. This step’s output can seamlessly feed into subsequent steps of the Workflow, enabling powerful and dynamic workflows tailored to your needs.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

In addition to combining channel steps and function steps to create complex workflows, you can augment these steps with additional logic based on the user recipient, inputs from your application, or the status of previous workflow steps. These are called step conditions.

## Step Conditions (Coming Soon)
Step conditions exist across both channel and function steps, and they allow you to conditionally execute steps based on trigger payload data, user properties, or the status of previous steps

Examples:

    - Only send an email message if an in-app message has not been seen
    - Only send an in-app notification if recipient.plan === "pro"
    - Only execute a delay step if delay === true in the trigger payload

In addition to giving your technical and non-technical users the ability to construct these workflows via a drag-and-drop editor, Novu also enables your users to exercise control over their own notification experience using a flexible preferences model.

## Preferences

In Novu, each workflow run is executed on behalf of a recipient, and each recipient can specify their preferences to receive notifications across a number of different criteria: channel types, individual workflows, and workflow categories.

![preferences](/getting-started/media-assets/preferences.png)

Application developers have control over how these preference sets are presented to the user and which options to surface, but Novu enforces these preferences during every workflow run automatically.

You can learn more about how to set a user's preferences in our [preferences overview](/docs/preferences/overview).

## Dashboard

The Dashboard is a user interface dedicated to managing the workflows, connecting integrations, debugging workflow execution, and more.
The dashboard experience can be optionally extended using the [Novu Framework SDK](/sdks/framework/typescript/overview).

## UI Components

Novu offers a set of full-stack components that can be embedded in your application to allow users to manage their notification preferences, view notification history, and more.

## Framework

<Tip>
Novu can run without a bridge endpoint, but was built to be extended to support any use case.
</Tip>

The bridge endpoint is an HTTP endpoint that is powered by the [Novu Framework SDK](/sdks/framework/typescript/overview) and should be [deployed](/deployment/syncing) in your own infrastructure. 
The endpoint is responsible for extending and customizing the notification platform with more complex logic, such as:

- Automating workflow creation with code powered by GitOps
- Creating custom components for email and other channels
- Abstracting away advanced logic by custom Dashboard controls.
- Executing advanced logic such as:
  - Fetching data from external APIs
  - Hydrating just-in-time subscriber and topic information
  - Decision making for delivery based on custom rules

### Keep learning

While the workflow engine is at the heart of Novu, our goal is to build a complete notification system for our customers. Here is an overview of some of the more-advanced features that we provide:

**UI components**

Novu provides developers with React components like `<NotificationFeed/>` and `<SlackAuthButton/>` to use in their applications. You can read more about building in-app UI with Novu for both web and mobile here.

**Advanced concepts**

There is a lot more to learn about Novu, and our concepts overview page is a good place to start. Here are use cases our customers commonly solve with Novu:

    Powering translation and localization and managing timezone-aware delivery
    Creating advanced notification logic using subscriptions and schedules
    Integrating Novu with your application's data model, using tenants and objects to power customized experiences
    Using the template editor to standarize messaging templates across providers

**Developer tools**

Novu is a developer-first platform, with both environment and commit models. If you want to work with Novu resources in code, you can use our Management API or CLI.

Once you're sending notifications through Novu, we offer observability tools like workflow run logs (to examine all steps of workflow execution in your dashboard) and data streaming into a monitoring system like Datadog with extensions.
