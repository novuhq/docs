Sending the first notification is fairly simple, and can be done from within the web dashboard. To send your first notification, follow these steps:

## Workflow for Email notifications

1. Navigate to the workflow section from the left sidebar:

   <Frame caption="Navigate to workflows from the left sidebar">
     <img src="/images/workflows.png" />
   </Frame>

2. Click on the `Blank Workflow` button to create an empty workflow:

   <Frame caption="Choose 'blank workflow'">
     <img src="/images/blank-workflow1.png" />
   </Frame>

3. You are now in the workflow editor. Here you can add steps to your workflow. We’ll just drag the email node from the right sidebar to our workflow as illustrated below:

   <Frame caption="Drag email to the workflow">
     <img src="/images/workflow-editor1.png" />
   </Frame>

4. Now, simply click on the email node, and add the subject and the notification
   text in the email node editor:

   <Frame caption="Add subject and notification text in the email node editor'">
     <img src="/images/email-node1.png" />
   </Frame>

5. Now, update the workflow and save it as shown in the image below:

   <Frame caption="Save the workflow you just created">
     <img src="/images/saving-workflow.png" />
   </Frame>

6. Now, to execute this workflow, click on the `get snippet` button from the workflow editor:

   <Frame caption="Execute the workflow by getting snippet">
     <img src="/images/execute.png" />
   </Frame>

7. From the `run a test` tab, you can change the email to which you want the notification. Once you’ve done that, simply click on the `Run Trigger` button on the bottom right:

   <Frame caption="Choose the email to which you want to send the notification">
     <img src="/images/run-a-test.png" />
   </Frame>

8. Now, go to the inbox and you’ll see the email notification there. Don’t forget also to check spam as it may sometimes land in there:

   <Frame caption="Check inbox to see the notification you triggered">
     <img src="/images/inbox.png" />
   </Frame>

9. This gif below captures the entire process:

## Workflow for In-App notifications

Creating workflows for sending in-app notifications is pretty straightforward. Just follow the following steps and you'll be good to go:

1. Head to `workflows` on the [Novu web dashboard](https://web.novu.co/workflows).

   <Frame caption="Navigate to workflows from the left sidebar">
     <img src="/images/workflows.png" />
   </Frame>

2. Click on the Blank Workflow button to create a workflow from scratch.

   <Frame caption="Choose 'blank workflow'">
     <img src="/images/blank-workflow1.png" />
   </Frame>

<Note>
  If you want to avoid creating a workflow from scratch, then instead of
  choosing `Blank Workflow`, select `All Templates` and you'll find a bunch of
  workflow templates that you can customize and use:
  <Frame caption="Choose 'All Templates if you don't want to create workflows from scratch'">
    <img src="/images/send-your-first-notification/SCR-20230830-qyst.png" />
  </Frame>
  <br />
  <Frame caption="And select a template that suits your requirements">
    <img src="/images/send-your-first-notification/SCR-20230830-qywy.png" />
  </Frame>
</Note>

3. You'll now end up in the workflow editor. Workflow editor, as the name suggests, is the place from where you can edit workflows. You can select which [channels](/channels-and-providers/introduction#channels) you want to send notifications in, add [digest](/guides/add-digest-to-inapp-notifications) to your in-app notifications and more.

   <Frame caption="Configure workflows in the workflow editor">
     <img src="/images/send-your-first-notification/SCR-20230831-jzdl.png" />
   </Frame>

4. For your use case here, we'll simply add an `in-app` node to our workflow.

   <Note>
     Don't forget to rename your workflow to an appropriate name.
     <Frame caption="Rename your workflow to an appropriate name">
       <img src="/images/send-your-first-notification/SCR-20230831-kaqq.png" />
     </Frame>
   </Note>

5. Now, the `in-app` node has a lot of options for you to configure:

   <Frame caption="The `in-app` node can be configured to match your requirements">
     <img src="/images/send-your-first-notification/SCR-20230831-kcqe.png" />
   </Frame>

- **Preview**: This shows you a glimpse of what each notification item will look like in the Notification Center UI.
- **Avatar:** If turned on, each notification item will show the avatar of the subscriber.
- **Action:** With this, you can add a primary and secondary call to action button to each notification item.
- **Notification Feeds:** This displays a stream of specific notifications. You can have multiple feeds to show specific notifications in multiple tabs.
- **Redirect URL** - This is the URL to which a subscriber can be directed when they click on a notification item.
- **Filter** - This feature allows you to configure the criteria for delivering notifications. For instance, you can apply a filter based on a subscriber's online status to send them an email if they were online within the last hour.

6. In this editor, you need to plug in the variable that your backend is expecting in the payload:

   <Frame caption="Plug the variable in this editor">
     <img src="/images/send-your-first-notification/SCR-20230831-kgka.png" />
   </Frame>

7. You can even use [handlebars](/content-creation-design/handlebars-helpers) to further customise this.

8. Once you're done configuring it, simply click the `update` button on the top right corner.

   <Frame caption="Click `update` to save your workflow">
     <img src="/images/send-your-first-notification/SCR-20230831-khui.png" />
   </Frame>

9. Now, simply click on the `Get Snippet` button to get the trigger code snippet.

   <Frame caption="Click `Get Snippet` to get the trigger code snippet">
     <img src="/images/send-your-first-notification/SCR-20230831-kjhb.png" />
   </Frame>

10. You'll get the code that you need to plug into your backend to be executed whenever an event fires.

    <Frame caption="Plug this code into your backend">
      <img src="/images/send-your-first-notification/SCR-20230831-klfw.png" />
    </Frame>
    <br />
    <Warning>
      Don't forget to use your actual `API_KEY` and `subscriberId`.
    </Warning>

That's it, you've successfully built a workflow for sending in-app notifications!

## Workflow for SMS notifications

SMS workflows are not very different from [email](/getting-started/send-your-first-notification#workflow-for-email-notifications) and [in-app](localhost:3001/getting-started/send-your-first-notification#workflow-for-in-app-notifications) workflows we've created above. Let's take a look at it:

1. Head to `Workflows` on the [Novu web dashboard.](https://web.novu.co/workflows)

   <Frame caption="Navigate to workflows from the left sidebar">
     <img src="/images/workflows.png" />
   </Frame>

2. Click on the `Blank Workflow` button to create a workflow from scratch.

   <Frame caption="Choose 'blank workflow'">
     <img src="/images/blank-workflow1.png" />
   </Frame>

<Note>
  If you want to avoid creating a workflow from scratch, then instead of
  choosing `Blank Workflow`, select `All Templates` and you'll find a bunch of
  workflow templates that you can customize and use:
  <Frame caption="Choose 'All Templates if you don't want to create workflows from scratch'">
    <img src="/images/send-your-first-notification/SCR-20230830-qyst.png" />
  </Frame>
  <br />
  <Frame caption="And select a template that suits your requirements">
    <img src="/images/send-your-first-notification/SCR-20230830-qywy.png" />
  </Frame>
</Note>

3. You'll now end up in the workflow editor. Workflow editor, as the name suggests, is the place from where you can edit workflows. You can select which [channels](/channels-and-providers/introduction#channels) you want to send notifications in, add [digest](/guides/add-digest-to-inapp-notifications) to your in-app notifications and more.

   <Frame caption="Configure workflows in the workflow editor">
     <img src="/images/send-your-first-notification/SCR-20230831-jzdl.png" />
   </Frame>

4. Since we're creating a workflow for SMS notifications, we'll drag the `SMS` step to our workflow, as shown in this picture below:

   <Frame caption="Add the SMS step to the workflow">
     <img src="/images/send-your-first-notification/SCR-20230831-pkxe.png" />
   </Frame>

5. If you hover over the SMS node, you will get a message saying 'Required - SMS content`. Click on the SMS node and add a message to it. This is what will be sent as a notification in the SMS.

   <Frame caption="Add a message that you want to send as notification">
     <img src="/images/send-your-first-notification/SCR-20230831-plrx.png" />
   </Frame>
   <br />
   <Note>
     Instead of having static messages, you can have your notifications be
     dynamic by using `handlebars`. Take a look
     [here](/content-creation-design/handlebars-helpers) for more. If your
     backend is expecting data in the payload, plug that variable here in double
     braces.
   </Note>

6. Once you’re done configuring it, simply click the update button on the top right corner.

   <Frame caption="Save the workflow by clicking on this `update` button">
     <img src="/images/send-your-first-notification/SCR-20230831-pmvs.png" />
   </Frame>

7. Now, simply click on the Get Snippet button to get the trigger code snippet.

   <Frame caption="You'll get the trigger code from the workflow editor itself">
     <img src="/images/send-your-first-notification/SCR-20230901-pung.png" />
   </Frame>

8. You’ll get the code that you need to plug into your backend to be executed whenever an event fires.

   <Frame caption="Just add your API key and subscriberID to this code">
     <img src="/images/send-your-first-notification/SCR-20230901-puwn.png" />
   </Frame>
   <Warning>Don’t forget to use your actual API_KEY and subscriberId.</Warning>
   That’s it, you’ve successfully built a workflow for sending in-app
   notifications!

## Workflow for Chat notifications

Chat workflows are quite similar to [email](/getting-started/send-your-first-notification#workflow-for-email-notifications), [in-app](localhost:3001/getting-started/send-your-first-notification#workflow-for-in-app-notifications), and [SMS workflows](/getting-started/send-your-first-notification#workflow-for-sms-notifications) workflows we've created above. Let's take a look at it in detail:

1. Head to `Workflows` on the [Novu web dashboard.](https://web.novu.co/workflows)

   <Frame caption="Navigate to workflows from the left sidebar">
     <img src="/images/workflows.png" />
   </Frame>

2. Click on the `Blank Workflow` button to create a workflow from scratch.

   <Frame caption="Choose 'blank workflow'">
     <img src="/images/blank-workflow1.png" />
   </Frame>
   <br />
   <Note>
     If you want to avoid creating a workflow from scratch, then instead of
     choosing `Blank Workflow`, select `All Templates` and you'll find a bunch
     of workflow templates that you can customize and use:
     <Frame caption="Choose 'All Templates if you don't want to create workflows from scratch'">
       <img src="/images/send-your-first-notification/SCR-20230830-qyst.png" />
     </Frame>
     <br />
     <Frame caption="And select a template that suits your requirements'">
       <img src="/images/send-your-first-notification/SCR-20230830-qywy.png" />
     </Frame>
   </Note>

3. You'll now end up in the workflow editor. Workflow editor, as the name suggests, is the place from where you can edit workflows. You can select which [channels](/channels-and-providers/introduction#channels) you want to send notifications in, add [digest](/guides/add-digest-to-inapp-notifications) to your in-app notifications and more.

   <Frame caption="Configure workflows in the workflow editor">
     <img src="/images/send-your-first-notification/SCR-20230831-jzdl.png" />
   </Frame>

4. Just add this `Chat` node to the workflow.

   <Frame caption="Add the `Chat` step">
     <img src="/images/send-your-first-notification/SCR-20230901-pxbj.png" />
   </Frame>

5. In the `Chat` node, you can enter the notification message. This is what will get sent to the [subscriber](/subscribers/subscribers) as a notification. If you're sending dynamic messages, use the variable that is expected in your payload in double braces here. Using [handlebars](/content-creation-design/handlebars-helpers), you can further extend this functionality.

   <Frame caption="Enter either the static notification text, or send dynamic notifications using variables and handlebar helpers">
     <img src="/images/send-your-first-notification/SCR-20230901-qaok.png" />
   </Frame>

6. Once you’re done configuring it, simply click the update button on the top right corner.

   <Frame caption="Click the `Update` button to save your workflow">
     <img src="/images/send-your-first-notification/SCR-20230901-qcqx.png" />
   </Frame>

7. Now, simply click on the Get Snippet button to get the trigger code snippet.

   <Frame caption="Click the `Get Snippet` button to get the trigger code">
     <img src="/images/send-your-first-notification/SCR-20230901-qcwk.png" />
   </Frame>

8. You’ll get the code that you need to plug into your backend to be executed whenever an event fires.

   <Frame caption="This is the code you need to execute to trigger this workflow and send notifications">
     <img src="/images/send-your-first-notification/SCR-20230901-qdih.png" />
   </Frame>
   <Warning>Don’t forget to use your actual API_KEY and subscriberId.</Warning>
   That’s it, you’ve successfully built a workflow for sending chat notifications!
