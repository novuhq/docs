Before you can start integrating Novu into your application, you need to create a Novu account and set up a new workflow in the Novu Dashboard. This guide walks you through those steps.


<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Novu account">
    [Create a new account](https://dashboard.novu.co/signup) on Novu Cloud or [sign in](https://dashboard.novu.co/login) if you already have an account.
</Step>
  
  <Step title="Add the Novu SDK into your backend">
    Our SDKs support [most major programming languages](/sdks/overview), making it easy to get started. Is your preferred language missing? [Reach out to us!](https://novu.co/contact)
    ```bash
    npm install @novu/node
    ```
</Step>

  <Step title="Configure environment variables">

  To start, set the `NOVU_API_KEY` environment variable in your application.  
  You can find your public and secret API keys in the **Developer** section of the Novu dashboard. Since this step is for backend integration, be sure to use the **secret key**.

  For security, always define your API key as an environment variable and avoid committing it to source control.
  ```bash
  NOVU_API_KEY= "example_key_abcdefg1234567890"
  ```
</Step>

  <Step title="Build a workflow">
    Navigate through the toggles to create your first custom workflow.
<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Create a new workflow">
    Create a new workflow by clicking on the **Create Workflow** button in the workflows page.
    - Give your workflow a name (e.g. "User Onboarding").
    - **Workflow identifier** will be generated automatically (e.g. `user-onboarding`).
    - Add **tags** (optional) : Tags are a great way to classify and filter workflows for you, and your users.
    - Add a **description** (optional) : Add a description to help you and your team understand the purpose of the workflow.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Add steps to your workflow">

  Every notification workflow starts with at least one [**channel step**](/workflow/channel-steps). To add a step, click the **Plus** button (**+**) in the Workflow Editor.

  <Frame>
    <img src="/getting-started/media-assets/add-steps.png" alt="Add steps to your workflow" />
  </Frame>

  In the editor, you can customize your workflow with various steps, including **Action steps** (e.g., [Digest](/workflow/digest) and [Delay](/workflow/delay)) and **[delivery channels](/workflow/channel-steps)**. Select a delivery channel to begin crafting your workflow.

  Workflows can include multiple steps, with each step sending a notification to the user. Steps execute in the order they are added.

  <AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="In-app" icon="Bell">
      **In-app** notifications are delivered directly inside your application via an Inbox or custom integration.

      [Learn more about the Custom action step](/workflow/custom)
    </Accordion>
  </AccordionGroup>
  </Accordion>


<Accordion title="Design the notification templates">
  Once you’ve added a channel step, you can customize the notification content. 
  
  Click **"Configure Channel Step Template"** in the channel's edit view to open the [Notification Template Editor](/workflow/template-editor) and start editing.

  <Frame>
    <img src="/getting-started/media-assets/notification-template.png" alt="Configure channel step template" />
  </Frame>

  Each channel has its own template editor, allowing you to customize the notification content for each channel based on the channel's capabilities.

  In this example, we're using the **In-App** channel step, so we're using the **In-App** template editor.

<Tip>
    **Here is an example of an In-App notification template:**

    **Title**
    ```json
    You’ve Got a New Task Assigned!
    ```
    **Body**
    ```json
    Hey {{subscriber.firstName}}, you've been assigned to a new task: {{payload.task_id.title}} 
    The deadline is {{payload.task_id.dueDate}}. Click below to view the details and get started.
    ```
    **Button Text**
    ```json
    View Task
    ```
    **Redirect URL**
    ```json
    {{payload.task_id.url}}
    ```
</Tip>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Preview your notification">
  Preview your notification by clicking the **Preview** button in the **Configure Template** section of the workflow editor.

  <Frame>
    <img src="/getting-started/media-assets/preview-notification.png" alt="Preview notification" />
  </Frame>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Test your workflow in the editor">
  You can test your workflow in the editor by clicking the **Test Workflow** button in the workflow editor.

  <Frame>
    <img src="/getting-started/media-assets/test-workflow.png" alt="Test workflow" />
  </Frame>

  <Info>
  [**In-app**](/integrations/providers/in-app/overview) channel is the only channel that doesn't require any credentials to be configured in the [**Subscriber** object](/concepts/subscribers).

  If you have [Email](/integrations/providers/email/overview), [SMS](/integrations/providers/sms/overview), [Push](/integrations/providers/push/overview) or [Chat](/integrations/providers/chat/overview) channels steps in your workflow, you need to ensure that you have the necessary credentials configured in the **Subscriber** object.

  - [Learn more about the Subscriber object](/concepts/subscribers)
  - [Learn more about how to add credentials to the Subscriber object](/api-reference/subscribers/update-subscriber-credentials)
  </Info>

  If you have the **In-app** channel step in your workflow, you can test your workflow in the editor with the default subscriber_id, you will see the notification in the **Inbox** section of the Novu dashboard.

  <Frame>
    <img src="/getting-started/media-assets/test-workflow-inbox.png" alt="Test workflow inbox" />
  </Frame>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Copy the sample payload">
  Before leaving the Workflow Editor and heading back to your backend, navigate to the **`Trigger`** tab. 
  
  Here, you can grab a sample payload to use when calling Novu's API.

  <Frame>
    <img src="/getting-started/media-assets/trigger-tab.png" alt="Trigger Tab" />
  </Frame>

  Based on the workflow we created, the sample payload will look like this:

  ```json
  {
    "task_id": {
      "title": "{{payload.task_id.title}}",
      "dueDate": "{{payload.task_id.dueDate}}",
      "url": "{{payload.task_id.url}}"
    }
  }
  ```

  <Tip>
    **Note:** The payload is optional, and can be used to pass additional information to the workflow.
  </Tip>

  At the bottom of the page, you can grab the workflow trigger snippet and add it to your backend.

<Frame>
  <img src="/getting-started/media-assets/trigger-snippet.png" alt="Workflow trigger snippet" />
</Frame>

  Now we're ready to trigger our workflow via the Novu API.

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Trigger the workflow">
    Each workflow is created with a unique identifier that can be used to trigger the workflow, visit the Trigger page to view the trigger instructions.

<Note>
    **Each trigger consists of 3 main parts:**
    - **Workflow identifier**: The unique identifier of the workflow to trigger.
    - **Subscriber ID**: The unique identifier of the subscriber to trigger the workflow for, this can be a user id, email or any unique identifier.
    - **Payload**: The payload to pass to the workflow, this is optional and can be used to pass additional information to the workflow.
</Note>

  In this example, we're using the [**Node.js SDK**](/sdks/nodejs) to trigger the workflow. But the same can be done with any of the [SDKs](/sdks/overview).

  Add the trigger snippet to your backend and call the trigger function with the **Workflow identifier**, **Subscriber ID** and **Payload**.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Node.js
  import { Novu } from '@novu/node'; 

  const novu = new Novu(process.env['NOVU_SECRET_KEY']);

  novu.trigger('test', { // Workflow Identifier
    to: {
      subscriberId: '625f3fe55a55980017dd63fd' // Subscriber ID
    },
    payload: { // Payload
      task_id: {
        title: '{{payload.task_id.title}}',
        dueDate: '{{payload.task_id.dueDate}}',
        url: '{{payload.task_id.url}}'
      }
    }
  });
  ```

  ```bash Curl
  curl -X POST 'https://api.novu.co/v1/events/trigger' \
    -H 'Authorization: ApiKey NOVU_SECRET_KEY' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
      "name": "test",
      "to": {
        "subscriberId": "625f3fe55a55980017dd63fd"
      },
      "payload": {
        "task_id": {
          "title": "{{payload.task_id.title}}",
          "dueDate": "{{payload.task_id.dueDate}}",
          "url": "{{payload.task_id.url}}"
        }
      }
    }'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**Execute the trigger call from your backend.**

<Info>
  If you have the **In-app** channel step in your workflow, you should see the notification in the **Inbox** section of the Novu dashboard.
