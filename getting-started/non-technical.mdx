Novu Framework was designed to bridge the gap between developers and on-developers in the team.

- **Developers** - Define and abstract away complex logic, data manipulation and hydration, html and etc...
- **Non-Developers** - Use the Novu Web UI to control the content and behavior of the notifications using [Inputs](/framework/concepts/inputs).

## How to Modify Inputs?

Inputs are modified directly on the [Novu Web UI](https://web.novu.co). Each Workflow editor page have an 'Inputs' tab where you can modify them.
When Saving the changes, the new Input values will be used in the notification sent to your subscriber.

## Common Input Usecases

### Change Notification Content

An input can be as broad as `content` or as specific as `2fa_code_title_color`. This allows you to change the content of the notification without needing to touch the code.

<Tip>
    Currently you cannot use Dynamic payload variables as part of the Input. Reach out to us if you need this capability.

### Change Digest or Delay Frequency

Inputs can be used for controlling any aspect of the step configuration, for example:

- Digest Length
- Delay Amount
- Digest Type (Daily, Weekly, Monthly)
- etc...

### Control structure and layout

Inputs can be used to show/hide or rearrange the layout of the notification.
For example, you can have an input to show/hide a button, or change the position of a specific email section.
