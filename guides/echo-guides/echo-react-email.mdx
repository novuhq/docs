# Introduction

In this guide, you’ll learn how to send email notifications using the React email package. But before we jump into it, let's first take a look at the prerequisites!

## Pre-requisites
- A Novu account
- Node installed on your machine
- A working NextJS development environment

## Get started with Echo

[Novu Echo](https://docs.novu.co/echo/quickstart) is a "notifications as code" approach that enables developers to define workflows as functions and integrate them with their preferred libraries for email, SMS, and chat generation.

1. To get started with Echo, just run this command in your terminal, it’ll scaffold a new NextJS project with Echo and we’ll be ready to roll!
```jsx
npx create-echo-app
```
2. Once you execute this command, you’ll be asked to give your project a name. I’ll keep the default `my-echo-app` but you can choose your own.
<Frame caption="Give your app a name"><img src="/images/echo-react-email/1.png" /> </Frame>
3. You’ll then be asked if you want to use React-email or not. You can choose to install it at this step itself or proceed with No and then install it later. I’m choosing the default No option.
<Frame caption="Choose if you want to install React email or not"><img src="/images/echo-react-email/2.png" /> </Frame>
4. After this step, all the dependencies will be installed and you will be able to start using the magic called Echo.
<Frame caption="Let all the dependencies get installed"><img src="/images/echo-react-email/3.png" /> </Frame>
5. Once this installation is complete, simply cd into the directory and start your app using the `npm run dev` command, and your app will be served on `localhost:4000`

<Note>
Make sure that the port 4000 isn’t already being used!
</Note>

You’ll now have a NextJS app running on `http://localhost:4000` and you can make changes to your app as you see fit. Let’s now move to the meaty stuff - using Novu Echo in a NextJS app and the magic of Dev Studio.

## Echo Dev Studio

The Echo Dev Studio is a companion app to the Echo Client SDK. Its goal is to provide a local environment that lives near your code.

To launch the dev studio locally you can run: `npx novu-labs@latest echo`. The Dev Studio will be started by default on port `2022`, and accessible via: `http://localhost:2022`
<Frame caption="Echo Dev Studio runs on 'localhost:2022' by default. Here I’m already using port 2022 so it is starting on a different port but we recommend ensuring that port 2022 is free"><img src="/images/echo-react-email/4.png" /> </Frame>

Here’s how the Dev Studio looks on the first run:
<Frame caption="Echo Dev Studio on the first run"><img src="/images/echo-react-email/5.png" /> </Frame>
You’ll notice that it asks for an `Echo endpoint` at the bottom. Novu Echo requires a single HTTP endpoint (`/api/echo` or similar) to be exposed by your application. This endpoint is used to receive events from our Worker Engine. We have more on Echo endpoint [in our docs.](https://docs.novu.co/echo/concepts/endpoint)

<Note>
You can view the Echo Endpoint as a webhook endpoint that Novu will call when it needs to retrieve contextual information for a given subscriber and notification.

</Note>

Just enter the full URL of your Echo Endpoint. In our case, it is `http://localhost:4000/api/echo`
<Frame caption="Enter Echo endpoint URL"><img src="/images/echo-react-email/6.png" /> </Frame>
Once you do, you’ll see a green checkmark alongside the URL input box and a green `connected` highlight at the top right corner.

## Installing and configuring React Email

Integrating React Email with Novu in our NextJS app is quite straightforward. Following are the steps to get it installed and configured:

1. Simply run the following command to install it like any other npm package:

```jsx
  npm i @react-email/components react-email
```

Once installed, proceed to write an email template in the next step

<Note>
If you opted for installing React Email in our CLI set-up process, you can skip installing it again.
</Note>

2. To write an email template, you can look over some of the examples in the [React Email documentation](https://react.email/examples) to get inspiration. In our case, this is the template:
```jsx
import {
  Body,
  Button,
  Container,
  Column,
  Head,
  Hr,
  Html,
  Img,
  Link,
  render,
  Row,
  Section,
  Text,
  Tailwind,
} from "@react-email/components";
import * as React from "react";

interface VercelInviteUserEmailProps {
  username?: string;
  userImage?: string;
  invitedByUsername?: string;
  invitedByEmail?: string;
  teamName?: string;
  teamImage?: string;
  inviteLink?: string;
  inviteFromIp?: string;
  showJoinButton?: boolean;
  inviteFromLocation?: string;
  buttonText?: string
}

const baseUrl = process.env.VERCEL_URL
  ? `https://${process.env.VERCEL_URL}`
  : "";

export const VercelInviteUserEmail = ({
  username,
  userImage,
  invitedByUsername,
  invitedByEmail,
  teamName,
  teamImage,
  inviteLink,
  inviteFromIp,
  inviteFromLocation,
  showJoinButton,
  buttonText
}: VercelInviteUserEmailProps) => {

              </Row>
            </Section>
            {showJoinButton && (
              <Section className="text-center mt-[32px] mb-[32px]">
                <Button
                  className="bg-[#000000] rounded text-white text-[12px] font-semibold no-underline text-center px-5 py-3"
                  href={inviteLink}

                </Button>
              </Section>
            )}
            <Text className="text-black text-[14px] leading-[24px]">
              or copy and paste this URL into your browser:{" "}
              <Link href={inviteLink} className="text-blue-600 no-underline">
                {inviteLink}
              </Link>
            </Text>
            <Hr className="border border-solid border-[#eaeaea] my-[26px] mx-0 w-full" />
            <Text className="text-[#666666] text-[12px] leading-[24px]">
              This invitation was intended for{" "}
              <span className="text-black">{username}</span>. This invite was
              sent from <span className="text-black">{inviteFromIp}</span>{" "}
              located in{" "}
              <span className="text-black">{inviteFromLocation}</span>. If you
              were not expecting this invitation, you can ignore this email. If
              you are concerned about your account's safety, please reply to
              this email to get in touch with us.
            </Text>
          </Container>
        </Body>
      </Tailwind>
    </Html>
  );
};

VercelInviteUserEmail.PreviewProps = {
  username: "alanturing",
  userImage: `${baseUrl}/static/vercel-user.png`,
  invitedByUsername: "Alan",
  invitedByEmail: "alan.turing@example.com",
  teamName: "Enigma",
  teamImage: `${baseUrl}/static/vercel-team.png`,
  inviteLink: "https://vercel.com/teams/invite/foo",
  inviteFromIp: "204.13.186.218",
  inviteFromLocation: "São Paulo, Brazil",
} as VercelInviteUserEmailProps;

export default VercelInviteUserEmail;

export function renderReactEmail(input: any, payload: any) {
  return render(<VercelInviteUserEmail {...input}{...payload} />);

}
```

3. And as final step, we need to define the workflow that uses the template defined above.
```jsx
const newSignup = echo.workflow('new-signup', async ({ step, payload }) => {
  // Send a welcome email
  await step.email('send-email', async (inputs) => {
    return {
      subject: `Welcome to Novu, ${payload.username}`,
      body: renderReactEmail(inputs, payload),
    };
  }, {
    inputSchema: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        showJoinButton: { type: "boolean", default: true },
        buttonText: { type: "string", default: "Join the team" },
        userImage: {
          type: "string",
          default: "https://react-email-demo-bdj5iju9r-resend.vercel.app/static/vercel-user.png",
          format: "uri",
        },
        invitedByUsername: { type: "string", default: "Alan" },
        invitedByEmail: {
          type: "string",
          default: "alan.turing@example.com",
          format: "email",
        },
        teamName: { type: "string", default: "Team Awesome" },
        teamImage: {
          type: "string",
          default: "https://react-email-demo-bdj5iju9r-resend.vercel.app/static/vercel-team.png",
          format: "uri",
        },
        inviteLink: {
          type: "string",
          default: "https://vercel.com/teams/invite/foo",
          format: "uri",
        },
        inviteFromIp: { type: "string", default: "204.13.186.218" },
        inviteFromLocation: {
          type: "string",
          default: "São Paulo, Brazil",
        },
      },
    },
  });
  // JSON Schema for validation and type-safety. Zod, and others coming soon.
}, { payloadSchema: { properties: { text: { type: 'string' } } } });
```
Once you do this, you’ll see this workflow, the steps in the workflow, step inputs, payload variables and, the rendered view of this workflow on the Echo Dev Studio:
<Frame caption="Echo Dev Studio now picks up the workflow we just created"><img src="/images/echo-react-email/7.png" /> </Frame>
Here, from the Dev Studio, you or your peers can change things like the text of a button, toggle visibility of a button, static text content, etc, and have it synced with the cloud with the `Sync to Cloud` button.

### Payload vs Step Inputs

Notice that in the Echo dev studio above, we’ve used payload as well as step inputs. Here’s how you can decide if you need either or both:

- Payload is used for dynamic content that changes from one notification to another based on events occurring in your system.
- Step Inputs are for static elements or predefined options that non-technical team members can modify without altering the codebase.
- Payload is controlled by developers and passed dynamically through the novu.trigger method.
- Step Inputs are defined by developers but are meant to be utilized and modified by non-technical peers.
- Payload examples include User ID, Post ID, Comment, Order ID, 2FA token, etc., which are likely to change with each notification.
- Step Inputs examples include the text of a button, whether a section should be shown, static text content, etc., which are generally static but configurable elements.
- Payload modifications are made in the code by developers at the time of triggering a notification.
- Step Inputs can be modified directly in the UI, offering a no-code solution for non-technical team members to make changes.
- Payload data is passed during the novu.trigger method and is part of the dynamic data handling process within notification workflows.
- Step Inputs are predefined in the workflow configuration and can be adjusted through the Echo Dev Studio, affecting how notifications are rendered without changing the workflow logic.

## Syncing with the cloud, with the click of a button

Once done with the workflow, now we need to sync it to the cloud. Fortunately, Echo makes it a breeze to sync changes from the local machine to the cloud and it all happens with a click of a button.

To enable our cloud environment to talk to your local Echo instance, you need to supply an Echo endpoint URL. This sets up a communication channel between our cloud environment and your local instance. To allow Novu to communicate with your local machine a tunnel will need to be generated. The quickest way to do it is with `localtunnel`. To this you can use either `localtunnel` or `ngrok`:
```bash
// using local tunnel
npx localtunnel --port <YOUR_EDGE_PORT>
```
```bash
// using ngrok 
ngrok http http://localhost:<YOUR_EDGE_PORT>      
```
In our case, the app is running on port 4000 so we’ll use:
```bash
ngrok http http://localhost:4000
```
This will create a tunnel and you’ll see something like this in the terminal:
<Frame caption="ngrok has done its magic"><img src="/images/echo-react-email/8.png" /> </Frame>
Remember, the exact URL (`/api/echo` or similar) you expose in your application for handling Echo requests is what you'd consider the `Echo URL`. 

This URL would be the endpoint within your application's domain where Novu's Worker Engine sends requests to fetch notification content or subscriber details dynamically. In our case, it is this: `https://0536-2409-40f2-1039-43e1-3053-d98e-c276-ee5.ngrok-free.app/api/echo`

So, we’ll enter this Echo URL:
<Frame caption="Enter the Echo URL in the Dev Studio"><img src="/images/echo-react-email/9.png" /> </Frame>
And create diff:
<Frame caption="Echo Dev Studio will create a diff for you"><img src="/images/echo-react-email/10.png" /> </Frame>

## Testing our workflow
Once you’ve synced your changes in the previous step, you’ll see a notification that says ‘Sync complete’ and you can now go to Novu Cloud using the ‘Test your workflows’ link and trigger a notification.
<Frame caption="Test your workflow will take you to Novu Cloud"><img src="/images/echo-react-email/11.png" /> </Frame>
You’ll see the workflow you’ve created using Echo with a blue lightning bolt icon. That icon signifies that the corresponding workflow has been created with Echo:
<Frame caption="You'll see the workflow created using Echo with the blue lightning bolt icon"><img src="/images/echo-react-email/12.png" /> </Frame>
Simply open the workflow and you can send a test email from there. 

<Note>
Make sure that all the expected payload variables and step inputs are being sent in their respective fields!
</Note>
<Frame caption="Enter the respective data and test your workflow"><img src="/images/echo-react-email/13.png" /> </Frame>
This is the workflow test email in my inbox:
<Frame caption="Workflow test email in my inbox"><img src="/images/echo-react-email/14.png" /> </Frame>
Once tested, you can simply have this workflow triggered whenever you want. For instance, a typical use case is to have a workflow triggered when an event occurs. To replicate it, I’ve attached a handler function that triggers this workflow when the `submit` event fires:

Here’s a simple replication of the stipulated scenario:
```jsx
"use client"
import Image from "next/image";
import styles from "./page.module.css";
import React, { useState } from "react";
import axios from "axios";

export default function Home() {

  const [email, setEmail] = useState('')
  const [username, setUsername] = useState('')

  const onClickHandler = async (e: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {
    try {
      e.preventDefault();
      await fetch("/api/users", {
        method: "POST",
        headers: {
          "Content-Type": "application/json",
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          email: email,
          username: username,
        }),
      });

      // console.log('working fine');
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error:', error);
    }
  };
  return (
    <main style={{ height: '100vh', display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      <form onSubmit={(e) => onClickHandler(e)}>
        <input
          placeholder="Enter email id"
          onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}
          style={{
            // Add your CSS-in-JS styles here
            padding: '0.5rem',
            marginBottom: '1rem',
            borderRadius: '0.25rem',
            border: '1px solid #ccc',
            width: '100%',
            boxSizing: 'border-box',
          }}
        />
        <input
          placeholder="Enter the name of invitee"
          onChange={(e) => setUsername(e.target.value)}
          style={{
            // Add your CSS-in-JS styles here
            padding: '0.5rem',
            marginBottom: '1rem',
            borderRadius: '0.25rem',
            border: '1px solid #ccc',
            width: '100%',
            boxSizing: 'border-box',
          }}
        />
        <div style={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center' }}>

          <button
            style={{
              // Add your CSS-in-JS styles here
              padding: '0.5rem 1rem',
              backgroundColor: '#4CAF50',
              color: 'white',
              border: 'none',
              borderRadius: '0.25rem',
              cursor: 'pointer',
            }}
          >
            Submit
          </button>
        </div>
      </form>
    </main>
  );
}
```
And the corresponding route it hits:
```jsx
import { Novu } from '@novu/node';

const novu = new Novu('<Your Novu API Key>');

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const res = await request.json();

  await novu.trigger('<Workflow name>', {
    to: {
      subscriberId: '<subscriber ID>',
    },
    payload: {
      email: res.email,
      username: res.username,
    },
  });

  console.log('triggered')
  return Response.json({ success: true });
}
```
## More workflow examples

Creating workflows with Echo is a breeze. Here are a couple of other examples from React email docs created with Echo:

1. AWS Email verification example
<Frame caption="AWS verification example"><img src="/images/echo-react-email/15.png" /> </Frame>
2. Apple invoice email example
<Frame caption="Apple invoice email example"><img src="/images/echo-react-email/16.png" /> </Frame>
So there you go!

This is how you create workflows using Echo and deploy your changes seamlessly to the Novu cloud. Don’t forget to share your workflows with us and as always, hit us up on Discord with any questions you might have!
