Novu provides a URL that you can use to setup webhook support for your integrated provider.

This enables to receive much more detailed information from the provider about the outgoing messages in the [Activity Feed](/platform/activity-feed) section.

Currently, only `Email` and `SMS` channels are supported with limited providers. Support for more providers will be added in future.

<Info> This feature is available only in our SaaS. This feature will not work in a self hosted environment. </Info>

## Get your Webhook URL

To get your provider specific webhook URL, follow the below steps:

- Open your already connected provider from the `Integration Store` page.
- Scroll down the modal to find the `Webhook URL` field.
- Copy the given URL to configure it on the provider's webhook setup page.
