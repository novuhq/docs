Inbound Webhook is a feature that allows processing of incoming emails for a domain or subdomain.
The feature parses contents of an email and POSTs the information to a specified URL in a `multipart/form-data` format.

## Steps to set up Inbound Webhook

1. Set up an MX Record:
   - Log in to your domain host's website and navigate to the MX Records page.
   - Create a new MX record for the subdomain you want to process incoming email (e.g. reply.yourdomain.com).
    <Warning>
        You must create a new record for this as this feature does not work if the MX record is already set on the domain.
        Here is an example with [route 53](https://medium.com/@deep_blue_day/how-to-create-a-subdomain-in-amazon-route-53-81918654f5bf)
    </Warning>
   - Assign the MX record a priority of 10 and point it to the specified inbound mail server that located on the admin dashboard on the Email Settings.
     <Info>

    </Warning>
