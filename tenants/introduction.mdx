Multi-tenancy is a common use case for a lot of companies that have multiple organizations that use their applications. In some cases, there is a need to separate the behavior of the notification system depending on the individual tenants. 

Currently, Novu supports the following customizations:

- Workflow level customizations
- Integration customizations

## Tenant Management 

Tenants can be created and modified via the [API](http://docs.novu.co/api-reference/tenants/get-tenants) or [Web](https://web.novu.co/tenants). Each tenant can have multiple fields on it:

* Identifier - The identifier is a unique value, and can be used later when pointing to this tenant during trigger calls.
* Name - A human-readable name of the tenant.
* Data - A custom data object that can store information about the tenant. This data can be later accessed inside workflows.

To create a tenant on the Novu web platform, follow these steps:

- Click on `Tenants` on the left sidebar.
- In the Tenants section, click on the `Add a tenant` button.
- Set a `Name` and `Tenant identifier`. The tenant identifier is automatically set once you add a name. However, you can modify it to your needs.
- Set a JSON-format `Custom properties` (optional).

## Workflow Level Customizations

When triggering a workflow, it is possible to pass the tenant information (id or object, in case of an object, novu will upsert the tenant if itâ€™s not existing) like so:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Node.js">
  ```js
    import { Novu } from '@novu/node';

    const novu = new Novu("<NOVU_API_KEY>");

    await novu.trigger('<WORKFLOW_TRIGGER_ID>',
      {
        to: {
          subscriberId: '<UNIQUE_SUBSCRIBER_IDENTIFIER>',
        },
        payload: {
          name: "Hello World",
        },
        actor: "actorId"
        tenant: "tenantIdentifier"
      }
    );
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="PHP">
  ```php
    use Novu\SDK\Novu;

    $novu = new Novu('<NOVU_API_KEY_HERE>');

    $novu->triggerEvent([
      'name' => '<WORKFLOW_TRIGGER_ID>',
      'payload' => [
        'name' => 'Hello'
      ],
      'to' => [
          'subscriberId' => '<UNIQUE_SUBSCRIBER_IDENTIFIER>'
      ],
      'actor': "actorId"
      'tenant': "tenantIdentifier"
    ]);
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The tenant information can now be used inside the workflow template in the following way:

```
{{ tenant.data.customProp }}
```

## Integration Level Customizations (COMING SOON)

When creating an integration, it will possible to create a condition where you can specify a delivery provider for a channel when a particular tenant id is matched.

The delivery provider specified will only be used if the trigger is executed with the tenant id.

<Warning> Unfortunately, this is not available at the moment. However, it will ship with the next release. </Warning>

## Tenant-specific Notification Content (COMING SOON)

When creating a step, variants could be created for each step including digest and delay. For each variant, conditions set can be applied on when this variant could be used. 

Using so different workflow configurations (for example digest duration) could be configured on the individual workflow for a given tenant.

It is also possible to use handlebars to have minor tenant adjustments in a single step:

```
<img src="{{tenant.data.logo}}" />
```

<Warning> Unfortunately, this is not available at the moment. We're currently working on making it available soon. </Warning>
