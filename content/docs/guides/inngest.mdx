## Why Use Novu with Inngest?

By combining these tools, you can:
- **Trigger Smart Notifications**: Send notifications across multiple channels (email, SMS, push, in-app) based on complex event triggers
- **Build Reliable Workflows**: Create robust notification pipelines with Inngest's state management and retry capabilities
- **Scale Effortlessly**: Handle high-volume notification workloads with Inngest's queue management
- **Maintain Observability**: Monitor your notification workflows in real-time through Inngest's dashboard

## What You'll Learn

This guide teaches you how to:
- Configure Novu and Inngest in your project
- Manage notification subscribers via Novu's API
- Create event-driven notification workflows with Inngest
- Use dynamic data to personalize your notifications

<Callout type="info">
New to Inngest? We recommend starting with their [quickstart guide](https://www.inngest.com/docs/getting-started) before continuing.
</Callout>

1. Install Novu's SDK in our project
    
    ```json
    npm i @novu/api
    ```

2. Create a new task
    <Callout>
    You can also add this trigger to an existing one or multiple tasks
    </Callout>

    
    Import Novu's SDK and provide the credentials to initialize the Novu instance.
    
    ```typescript
    import { Novu } from "@novu/api";
    
    const novu = new Novu({ 
      secretKey: 'ApiKey ' + process.env['NOVU_SECRET_KEY']
    });
    ```
    
    For the sake of this guide, we will create a new dedicated functions for 2 common Novu actions:
    
    - Trigger Notification Workflow
    - Add New Subscriber

## Trigger Notification Workflow from an Inngest function

You can trigger Novu notification workflows directly from your Ingest function. This allows you to send notifications based on events or completions within your background jobs.

To trigger a Novu workflow, you'll use the Novu Node.js SDK within your Inngest's `createFunction` method.

### Core Requirements

When calling Novu's `trigger` method, you must provide the following information:

1. `workflowId` **(string):** This identifies the specific notification workflow you want to execute.
    - **Note:** Ensure this workflow ID corresponds to an existing, active workflow in your Novu dashboard.
2. `to` **(object):** This object specifies the recipient of the notification. At a minimum, it requires:
    - `subscriberId` **(string):** A unique identifier for the notification recipient within your system (e.g., a user ID).
    
    **Note:** If a subscriber with this `subscriberId` doesn't already exist in Novu, Novu will automatically create one when the workflow is triggered. You can also pass other identifiers like `email`, `phone`, etc., within the `to` object, depending on your workflow steps.
    

### Basic Trigger Example

Here's a simple Inngest function that triggers a Novu workflow when the function is being invoked. It assumes the function invoke receives a `userId` and `email` in its payload.

```tsx
import { inngest } from "./client";
import { Novu } from "@novu/api";

const novu = new Novu({ 
    secretKey: 'ApiKey ' + process.env['NOVU_SECRET_KEY']
  });

export const sendNotification = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "send-notification" },
  { event: "test/hello.world" },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    await step.run("send-welcome-email", async () => {
        await novu.trigger({
            workflowId: "welcome-email",
            to: {
                subscriberId: event.data.userId,
                email: event.data.email,
            },
            payload: {},
        });
    });

    return { message: `Welcome email sent to ${event.data.email}!` };
  },
);
```

### Adding Dynamic Content with `payload`

Often, you'll want your notifications to include dynamic data related to the event that triggered them (e.g., a user's name, an order number, job details). 

This is done using the `payload` property in the `novu.trigger` call.

The `payload` is an object containing key-value pairs that you can reference within your Novu notification templates using Handlebars syntax (e.g., `{{ name }}`, `{{ order.id }}`).

**Use Case Example:**

Imagine you want to send an email confirming a background job's completion:

- **Subject:** `Function {{ functionName }} Completed Successfully!`
- **Body:** `Hi {{ userName }}, your function '{{ functionName }}' finished processing.`

To achieve this, you would pass the `userName` and `functionName` in the `payload` object when triggering the workflow.

### Trigger Example with Payload

Let's modify the previous function to accept more data (like a user's `name`) in its own payload and pass relevant parts to the Novu `trigger` payload.

```typescript
import { inngest } from "./client";
import { Novu } from "@novu/api";

const novu = new Novu({ 
  secretKey: 'ApiKey ' + process.env['NOVU_SECRET_KEY']
});

export const sendNotification = inngest.createFunction(  
  { id: "send-notification" },
  { event: "test/hello.world" },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    await step.run("send-welcome-email", async () => {
      try {
        // Construct the payload specifically for Novu
        const novuPayload = {
          userName: event.data.userName,   // Map 'name' from task payload to 'userName' for the template
          functionName: `Data Processing Function #${event.id}`, // Can include static text or transform data
        };

        await novu.trigger({
          workflowId: "inbox-test", // Use the appropriate workflow ID
          to: {
            subscriberId: event.data.userId,
            email: event.data.email,
          },
          payload: {
            ...novuPayload,
          },
        });

        console.log("Novu workflow triggered successfully with payload:", novuPayload);
        return novuPayload;

      } catch (error: unknown) {
        const errorMessage = error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Unknown error triggering Novu';
        console.error("Failed to trigger Novu workflow with payload:", errorMessage, error);
        throw new Error(`Novu trigger failed: ${errorMessage}`);
      }
    });
  },
);
```

## Add a New Subscriber to Novu

Before sending notifications, Novu needs to know *who* to notify. That's where subscribers come in. A **subscriber** in Novu represents a user (or entity) that can receive notifications through one or more channels (in-app, email, SMS, etc.).

You can create a new subscriber programmatically from a Inngest's task using Novu's SDK.

---

### When Should You Create Subscribers?

Create or update a subscriber in Novu when:

- A new user signs up or is added to your system
- A user becomes eligible to receive notifications
- You want to ensure subscriber metadata (name, phone, etc.) is up-to-date

<Callout>

If you trigger a workflow with a `subscriberId` that doesn't exist, Novu will auto-create the subscriber. However, doing it explicitly ensures full control over subscriber data.

</Callout>

### Create a Subscriber in a Task

Below is a task that creates a Novu subscriber using a Inngest task. It also supports optional fields like `phone` and `avatar`.

```typescript
import { inngest } from "./client";
import { Novu } from "@novu/api";

const novu = new Novu({ 
  secretKey: 'ApiKey ' + process.env['NOVU_SECRET_KEY']
});

export const createSubscriber = inngest.createFunction(  
  { id: "create-subscriber" },
  { event: "app/account.created" },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    await step.run("create-subscriber", async () => {
      try {
        // Construct the payload specifically for Novu
        const subscriberPayload = Object.fromEntries(
          Object.entries({
            subscriberId: event.data.userId,
            email: event.data.email,
            firstName: event.data.firstName,
            lastName: event.data.lastName,
            phone: event.data.phone,
            avatar: event.data.avatar,
            locale: event.data.locale,
            data: event.data.userName ? { userName: event.data.userName } : undefined
          }).filter(([, value]) => value !== undefined)
        ) as {
          subscriberId: string;
          email?: string;
          firstName?: string;
          lastName?: string;
          phone?: string;
          avatar?: string;
          locale?: string;
          data?: { userName: string };
        };

        await novu.subscribers.create(subscriberPayload);

        console.log("Novu subscriber created successfully with payload:", subscriberPayload);
        return subscriberPayload;

      } catch (error: unknown) {
        const errorMessage = error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Unknown error creating Novu subscriber';
        console.error("Failed to create Novu subscriber with payload:", errorMessage, error);
        throw new Error(`Novu subscriber creation failed: ${errorMessage}`);
      }
    });
  },
);
```

## Implementation Example

This example assumes:

1. You have an event named `video/uploaded` that is being sent to Inngest when a user uploads a video.
2. This event's `data` payload includes at least `videoUrl`, `videoId`, `userId`, `email`, and `userName`.
3. You have external services/functions mocked or implemented: `deepgram.transcribe`, `llm.createCompletion`, `createSummaryPrompt`, and `db.videoSummaries.upsert`.
4. You have a Novu account, API Key (`NOVU_SECRET_KEY` environment variable), and a Novu workflow created with the ID `video-processed-notification`. 
This workflow should expect variables like `userName`, `videoId`, and potentially `summarySnippet` in its payload.

```typescript
import { Inngest } from "inngest";
import { Novu } from "@novu/api";

// --- Mock/Placeholder External Services ---
// Replace these with your actual implementations
const deepgram = {
  transcribe: async (url: string): Promise<string> => {
    console.log(`Mock Transcribing: ${url}`);
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1500)); // Simulate network delay
    return `This is a mock transcript for the video at ${url}. It contains several sentences explaining the content.`;
  }
};

const llm = {
  createCompletion: async (params: { model: string; prompt: string }): Promise<string> => {
    console.log(`Mock Summarizing with ${params.model}`);
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000)); // Simulate LLM processing time
    const transcriptSnippet = params.prompt.substring(params.prompt.indexOf(":") + 1, 70);
    return `Mock summary of the transcript starting with: ${transcriptSnippet}...`;
  }
};

const createSummaryPrompt = (transcript: string): string => {
  return `Please summarize the following transcript:\n\n${transcript}`;
};

const db = {
  videoSummaries: {
    upsert: async (data: { videoId: string; transcript: string; summary: string }): Promise<void> => {
      console.log(`Mock DB Upsert for videoId: ${data.videoId}`);
      // In a real scenario, save data.transcript and data.summary linked to data.videoId
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500)); // Simulate DB write delay
    }
  }
};
// --- End Mock Services ---

// --- Inngest Client Setup ---
// Assumes you have your Inngest client initialized elsewhere (e.g., './inngest/client')
// For this example, we'll initialize it here. Replace with your actual client setup.
export const inngest = new Inngest({ id: "video-processing-app" });
// --- End Inngest Client Setup ---

// --- Novu Client Setup ---
const novu = new Novu({ 
  secretKey: 'ApiKey ' + process.env['NOVU_SECRET_KEY']
});
// --- End Novu Client Setup ---

// --- Combined Inngest Function ---
export const processVideoAndNotify = inngest.createFunction(
  {
    id: "process-video-and-notify",
    name: "Process Uploaded Video and Notify User",
    // Apply concurrency limits per user to avoid overwhelming resources
    concurrency: {
      limit: 3, // Allow up to 3 concurrent processing jobs per user
      key: "event.data.userId"
    }
  },
  { event: "video/uploaded" }, // Triggered when a video upload event occurs
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    const { videoUrl, videoId, userId, email, userName } = event.data;

    // Validate required data from the event
    if (!videoUrl || !videoId || !userId || !email || !userName) {
        throw new Error(`Missing required data in 'video/uploaded' event payload for event ID: ${event.id}`);
    }

    // --- Step 1: Transcribe Video ---
    // step.run ensures this block retries on failure and runs exactly once on success.
    const transcript = await step.run('transcribe-video', async () => {
      console.log(`Starting transcription for videoId: ${videoId}, url: ${videoUrl}`);
      try {
        const result = await deepgram.transcribe(videoUrl);
        console.log(`Transcription successful for videoId: ${videoId}`);
        return result;
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Transcription failed for videoId: ${videoId}`, error);
        throw error; // Re-throw to enable Inngest retries
      }
    });

    // --- Step 2: Summarize Transcript ---
    // The 'transcript' result from the previous step is automatically available here.
    const summary = await step.run('summarize-transcript', async () => {
      console.log(`Starting summarization for videoId: ${videoId}`);
      try {
        const result = await llm.createCompletion({
          model: "gpt-4o", // Or your preferred model
          prompt: createSummaryPrompt(transcript),
        });
        console.log(`Summarization successful for videoId: ${videoId}`);
        return result;
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Summarization failed for videoId: ${videoId}`, error);
        throw error; // Re-throw for retries
      }
    });

    // --- Step 3: Write Results to Database ---
    await step.run('write-summary-to-db', async () => {
      console.log(`Writing transcript and summary to DB for videoId: ${videoId}`);
      try {
        await db.videoSummaries.upsert({
          videoId: videoId,
          transcript,
          summary,
        });
        console.log(`DB write successful for videoId: ${videoId}`);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(`DB write failed for videoId: ${videoId}`, error);
        throw error; // Re-throw for retries
      }
    });

    // --- Step 4: Send Completion Notification via Novu ---
    // This step runs only after the previous steps have succeeded.
    await step.run("send-completion-notification", async () => {
      if (!novuApiKey) {
        console.warn(`Skipping notification for videoId ${videoId} as NOVU_SECRET_KEY is not set.`);
        return { skipped: true, reason: "NOVU_SECRET_KEY not set" };
      }

      console.log(`Attempting to send Novu notification for videoId: ${videoId} to user: ${userId}`);

      // Construct a relevant payload for your Novu template
      const novuPayload = {
        userName: userName,
        videoId: videoId,
        summarySnippet: summary.substring(0, 100) + (summary.length > 100 ? "..." : ""), // Send a preview
        // Add any other data your Novu template needs, e.g., a link to view the full video/summary
        // videoUrl: `https://yourapp.com/videos/${videoId}`
      };

      try {
        const triggerResult = await novu.trigger({
          // Ensure this workflow ID exists in your Novu dashboard
          workflowId: "video-processed-notification",
          to: {
            subscriberId: userId, // Crucial for identifying the user in Novu
            email: email, // Can be used by Novu email channel
            // Add other channels like phone if needed and available
          },
          payload: novuPayload,
        });

        console.log(`Novu workflow 'video-processed-notification' triggered successfully for videoId: ${videoId}`, triggerResult);
        return { success: true, novuPayload: novuPayload, triggerResult };

      } catch (error: unknown) {
        const errorMessage = error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Unknown error triggering Novu';
        console.error(`Failed to trigger Novu workflow for videoId: ${videoId}: ${errorMessage}`, error);
        // Decide if notification failure should cause the step to fail and retry
        // For notifications, often you might want to log the error but not fail the whole function
        // throw new Error(`Novu trigger failed: ${errorMessage}`); // Uncomment to make it retry
         return { success: false, error: errorMessage }; // Log and continue
      }
    });

    // --- Function Completion ---
    // Optional: return a final status or summary
    return {
      message: `Video processing and notification steps completed for videoId: ${videoId}`,
      videoId: videoId,
      userId: userId,
      summaryLength: summary.length,
    };
  }
);

// --- How to Trigger (Example) ---
/*
Somewhere else in your application (e.g., after a file upload completes):

import { inngest } from "./path/to/inngest/client"; // Your initialized Inngest client

async function handleVideoUpload(uploadResult: { url: string, id: string, user: { id: string, email: string, name: string } }) {
  await inngest.send({
    name: "video/uploaded", // The event name our function listens to
    data: {
      videoUrl: uploadResult.url,
      videoId: uploadResult.id,
      userId: uploadResult.user.id,
      email: uploadResult.user.email,
      userName: uploadResult.user.name,
    },
    user: { // Optionally pass user context if needed for event metadata/tracking
        id: uploadResult.user.id,
        email: uploadResult.user.email,
    }
  });
  console.log(`Sent 'video/uploaded' event for videoId: ${uploadResult.id}`);
}

// Example usage:
handleVideoUpload({
    url: "https://example.com/videos/123.mp4",
    id: "vid_12345abc",
    user: { id: "user_67890def", email: "test@example.com", name: "Alice" }
});
*/
```

### Template Usage Example

Once you've added custom fields (like `firstName`, `userName`, or `phone`) to a subscriber, you can use them in Novu templates using Handlebars:

- Hi `{{subsciber.firstName}}`, welcome!
- We'll reach you at `{{subsciber.phone}}` if needed.
- Your account is set up under `{{subscriber.data.userName}}`.

---

### Best Practices

- Store your Novu `subscriberId` as part of your user model — so you always have a reference.
- Create/update subscribers proactively when user data changes (e.g., phone number updates).
- Use `data` to store additional info like roles, tags for more personalized notifications.
