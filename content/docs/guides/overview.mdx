## Integration Guides

Novu provides various ways to integrate with external services to trigger notification workflows. Here are the main integration approaches:

### Webhook Integration Guides

Webhooks enable real-time event-driven communication between applications, making integrations more efficient and responsive.  

In Novu, webhooks trigger notification workflows whenever specific events occur in external applications. This ensures notifications are delivered exactly when they're needed, keeping users informed without delay.

For example, when a user signs up via Clerk or completes a payment through Stripe, a webhook delivers the event payload to Novu, which then processes it and triggers the appropriate workflow.

This allows for real-time notifications—whether it's a welcome email, payment confirmation SMS, or in-app alert—without the need for constant polling, ensuring efficiency and a seamless user experience.

### Analytics & Data Platform Integrations

Some integrations use different mechanisms than webhooks to send data to Novu. For example, analytics and data platforms often use custom destinations or functions to forward events.

  <p>
    Use Segment's Destination Functions to forward user events and traits to trigger notification workflows.

### Workflow Automation Platform Integrations

Workflow automation platforms help orchestrate complex business processes and event-driven workflows. Integrating Novu with these platforms allows you to trigger notifications as part of your automated workflows.
