description: 'Understand common errors in your notification workflows and how to resolve them'
---


The Activity Feed page in the Novu dashboard displays all the events that occur when a workflow is triggered. Each triggered workflow includes a log for every step, showing whether a notification failed and why. Below are some common errors you may encounter.

## Webhook URL for the chat channel is missing

This happens when the subscriber is missing the required chat channel provider credentials, specifically, the webhook URL. Chat providers require a valid webhook URL to receive notifications.

**Solution:**

Ensure that the correct webhook URL is configured for the subscriber’s chat provider. [Read more about updating webhook URLs](/platform/integrations/chat#update-credential-webhookurl).


## All chat channels failed to send the message

When the workflow engine attempts to send a chat message, it tries all active chat providers. This error occurs when every configured provider fails to deliver the message.

**Solution:**

Check the individual chat provider configurations and logs to identify why each failed. Verify credentials, webhook URLs, and provider availability.

## Subscriber is missing a phone number

To send an SMS, the subscriber must have a valid phone number. If this field is missing, the system cannot deliver the message.

**Solution:**

Update the subscriber profile with a valid phone number. Similar errors may include missing recipient details. [Learn how to create and update subscriber attributes](/platform/concepts/subscribers).

## Subscriber does not have an active integration

The system couldn't send the message because the required chat or push providers are not configured in the integration store. As a result, the subscriber lacks the credentials needed to use these channels.

**Solution:**

Configure the appropriate chat or push provider in the integration store. This allows the subscriber to inherit the necessary credentials.

## Subscriber does not have a configured channel

This error indicates that the subscriber is not associated with any configured credentials for chat or push channels.

**Solution:**

Ensure the subscriber is mapped to an integration that supports the desired channel. [Read more on configuring chat and push channels](/platform/integrations/push).


## Message content could not be generated

This usually happens due to invalid characters in the step editor content. For example, if it’s an email step, it could be caused by a syntax error in the email editor.

**Solution:**

Review the content in the step editor and ensure it contains valid syntax and characters. Correct any formatting or special character issues.

## Novu's provider limit has been reached

Each environment in Novu is provisioned with demo providers for email and SMS channels. These demo providers are limited to 300 emails and 20 SMS per month.

**Solution:**

Upgrade to a production provider or reset the limit for testing. Avoid using demo providers for production use cases.

## Bridge execution failed

This error occurs when the bridge URL is invalid or unreachable during the execution of a workflow step.

**Solution:**

Verify that the bridge URL is correctly set, publicly accessible (if needed), and responds within a reasonable timeout.
