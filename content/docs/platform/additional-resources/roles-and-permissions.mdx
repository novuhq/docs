Novu uses a role-based access control (RBAC) model at the organization level. Each member in the organization is assigned a role that determines the actions they can perform within the Novu dashboard.

You assign a role to a team member when you invite them to your Novu organization. You can later update their role from the [Team section](https://dashboard.novu.co/settings/team) in your organization settings.

Below is an overview of the four roles available in Novu:
- **Owner**. For your primary account administrator. This role has full access across the platform, including organization-level settings, billing, API keys, environment management, and user administration. Each Novu organization must have at least one owner.

- **Admin**. For users who manage configuration and operational aspects of Novu. Admins can manage workflows, integrations, subscribers, environments, and message logs. They do not have access to billing.

- **Author**. For users who design and update notification workflows. Authors can create and modify workflows, preview steps, manage topics, and trigger events. They do not have access to organization-level settings, billing, or member management.

- **Viewer**. For read-only users. Viewers can view workflows, environments, logs, and messages, but cannot create, update, or delete resources.
