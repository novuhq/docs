Novu uses a role-based access control (RBAC) model at the organization level. Each member in the organization is assigned a role that determines the actions they can perform within the Novu dashboard.

You assign a role to a team member when you invite them to your Novu organization. You can later update their role from the [Team section](https://dashboard.novu.co/settings/team) in your organization settings.

  This feature is available to users on the Team and Enterprise pricing plans, and it is supported on both the new dashboard and the legacy dashboard.

Below is an overview of the four roles available in Novu:
- **Owner**. For your primary account administrator. This role has full access across the platform, including organization-level settings, billing, API keys, environment management, and user administration. Each Novu organization must have at least one owner.

- **Admin**. For users who manage configuration and operational aspects of Novu. Admins can manage workflows, integrations, subscribers, environments, and message logs. They do not have access to billing.

- **Author**. For users who design and update notification workflows. Authors can create and modify workflows, preview steps, manage topics, and trigger events. They do not have access to organization-level settings, billing, or member management.

- **Viewer**. For read-only users. Viewers can view workflows, environments, logs, and messages, but cannot create, update, or delete resources.
