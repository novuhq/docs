You can manage members of your organization under **Settings** > **Team** in your Novu dashboard.

<Callout type="info">Every user can view members, but only owners can invite or manage members in your organization.</Callout>

## Invite members to your organization

You can invite new members to your organization by selecting the **Invite** button on the **Team** page. This option is available from the **Members**, **Invitations**, or **Requests** tabs. You’ll need to provide the user’s email address to send the invitation.

Invited users appear under the **Invitations** tab until they accept. Once accepted, they are moved to the **Members** tab. If an invitation is not accepted, you can revoke it at any time to immediately invalidate it. By default, invited users are assigned the **Viewer** role when they join the organization.

## Domain-based invitations

To simplify onboarding, you can associate an email domain with your organization. Anyone who signs up to Novu using a matching email domain as yours will be able to request to join your organization or automatically join, depending on your organization’s settings.

<Callout type="info">Users who join through domain-based invitations are assigned the Viewer role by default.</Callout>

## Managing pending invites

Pending invitations appear in the **Invitations** tab until the invited user accepts or the invitation is revoked. You can revoke an invitation at any time. This will immediately make the invitation link invalid. After revoking, you can still resend or re-invite the user to your organization.

## Managing join requests

Users with matching domains can also request to join your organization. These Requests will appear in the **Requests** tab and only Owners can approve or decline join requests.

## Updating a member's role

Roles can be updated from the **Members** tab using the role dropdown for each user. You can pick from one of the [available account roles](/platform/additional-resources/roles-and-permissions). This change takes effect immediately and members cannot change their own role.

<Callout type="info">The last owner of an organization cannot have their role changed. Every organization must have an owner.</Callout>

## Removing members from your organization

You can remove members from your organization from the **Members** tab using the action menu (⋯) next to their name. Removing a member immediately revokes their access to your organization dashboard.

<Callout type="info">The owner who created the organization cannot be removed. Members can also leave your organization.</Callout>
