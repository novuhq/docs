## List of key terms and definitions

### Actor

An `actor` refers to a user or subscriber who initiates actions that trigger events within the system. Each actor is uniquely identified by an "actorId," also known as "subscriberId". Actors hold user-related variables and can enhance notifications by allowing their avatars to be displayed.

### Channels

Novu lets you send notifications across different communication mediums, including emails, in-app messages, push notifications, SMS, and chat. Each of these five communication mediums is referred to as a notification 'channel'.

### Delay Actions

Delay actions introduce time intervals between workflow steps, optimizing message delivery timing.

### Digest Engine

The digest engine aggregates multiple trigger events into a single message, ensuring efficient communication.

### Environments

Novu runs all your requests in the context of an environment. By default, Novu creates two environments:

1. Development environment: For testing purposes and validating notification changes
2. Production environment: Your live environment (read-only, changes must be promoted from development)

Data associated with an environment includes:

- Subscribers (can't be promoted to production)
- Workflows (can be promoted to production)
- Messages
- Execution logs
- Connected integrations (can't be promoted to production)
- Notification feeds (can be promoted to production)
- Brand-related assets and settings
