### Notification

### Subscribers

Subscribers are entities designated to receive the notifications you send. Each subscriber in Novu is uniquely identified by their `subscriberId`.

### Actor

An `actor` refers to a user or subscriber who initiates actions that trigger events within the system. Each actor is uniquely identified by an "actorId," also known as "subscriberId". Actors hold user-related variables and can enhance notifications by allowing their avatars to be displayed.

### Workflow

Workflow templates define the flow of messages sent to subscribers.

### Topics

Topics facilitate bulk notifications to multiple subscribers simultaneously, streamlining communication.

### Digest Engine

The digest engine aggregates multiple trigger events into a single message, ensuring efficient communication.

### Delay Actions

Delay actions introduce time intervals between workflow steps, optimizing message delivery timing.

### Step Filter

Step filters customize workflow by specifying notification criteria, enhancing communication efficiency.

### Organizations

Organizations allow separation of notifications across multiple products, managed through the Novu web dashboard.

### Environments

Novu runs all your requests in the context of an environment. By default, Novu creates two environments:

1. Development environment: For testing purposes and validating notification changes
2. Production environment: Your live environment (read-only, changes must be promoted from development)

Data associated with an environment includes:

- Subscribers (can't be promoted to production)
- Workflows (can be promoted to production)
- Messages
- Execution logs
- Connected integrations (can't be promoted to production)
- Notification feeds (can be promoted to production)
- Brand-related assets and settings

### Team members

Members of a team have access to the Novu web dashboard. This allows you to have individuals work on and manage templates and notifications.

### Layouts

Layouts are HTML designs or structures to wrap the content of email notifications. Layouts can be manipulated and assigned to new or existing workflows within the Novu platform.
