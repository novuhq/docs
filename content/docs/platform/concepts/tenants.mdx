import { Tooltip, TooltipContent, TooltipProvider, TooltipTrigger } from '@/components/ui/tooltip';

Multi-tenancy is a common use case for a lot of companies that have multiple organizations that use their applications. In some cases, there is a need to separate the behavior of the notification system depending on the individual tenants.

Tenants are also commonly called workspaces or organizations.

Some of the common multi-tenancy use cases are:

- Group subscribers notification feeds by the tenant
- Adjust the content of the notification depending on the tenant

## How to implement multi-tenancy in Novu

Novu supports multi-tenancy out of the box, the most simple way to implement tenant separation is by prefixing the subscriber identifier with the :tooltip[tenant identifier]{label="The tenant identifier is a unique identifier for the tenant in your application. Usually the tenant id in your database."}

```typescript
const subscriberId = `${tenantId}:${userId}`;

await novu.trigger({
  workflowId,
  to: {
    subscriberId,
  },
  payload: {
    tenantId,
  },
});
```

### Tenant in Inbox

When using the Inbox feature, you can use the tenant identifier to group notifications by tenant.

```tsx
import { Inbox } from "@novu/react";

function InboxComponent({ tenantId, userId }) {
  return <Inbox subscriber={`${tenantId}:${userId}`} />;
}
```

Each subscriber in a tenant will have it's own unique inbox feed, including a separate preference configuration set.

## Adjusting notification content based on tenant

When triggering a notification, you can pass a custom tenant object or identifier and use it to manipulate workflows or content.

```typescript
const subscriberId = `${tenantId}:${userId}`;

await novu.trigger({
  workflowId,
  to: {
    subscriberId,
  },
  payload: {
    tenant: {
      id: tenantId,
      name: "Airbnb",
      logo: "https://airbnb.com/logo.png",
      primaryColor: "red",
    }
  },
});
```

The tenant object will be available to use in the workflow editor as a variable for the following areas:

- Content (use `{{payload.tenant.name}}` to display the tenant name in an email or any other channel)
- Step Conditions (use `{{payload.tenant.id}}` to conditionally execute a step based on the tenant)
- Use the Inbox [data object](/platform/inbox/react/components/inbox#data-object) to filter notifications by tenant.
