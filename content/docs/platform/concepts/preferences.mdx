Novu provides a way to store subscriber preferences. This allows subscribers, your users, to specify and manage their preferences and customize their notifications experience.

**Levels of preferences:**

- Workflow channel preferences
- Subscriber channel preferences per workflow
- Subscriber global preferences

## Workflow channel preferences

Each workflow has its own channel preferences. By default all channel preferences are enabled. If disabled, subscriber will not receive notifications for that step channel.

Steps to manage workflow channel preferences:

1. Go to the [Workflows page](https://dashboard.novu.co/workflows) in Novu dashboard
2. Click the workflow you want to manage channel preferences for
3. A node based editor will appear. On the right side of the editor, Click on the `Configure channel preferences` option
4. Click on the All Channels checkbox to enable or disable all channels for the workflow
5. You will be able to change the preferences for only those steps which are present in the workflow. Non existing channel steps will be disabled.
6. `Mark as critical` toggle will make this worklfow as critical. Read more about [critical workflows](#critical-workflows)

  If a workflow has only `in-app` and `email` steps, then it will have only `in-app` and `email` preferences.
</Callout>

### Critical workflows

In some cases, you don't want the subscriber to be able to unsubscribe from mandatory notifications such as Account Verification, Password Reset, etc...

In those cases you can mark a workflow as `critical` in workflow channel preferences. Critical workflow are not displayed in the subscriber preferences and hence subscriber will not be able to change the preferences for that workflow.


## Subscriber global preferences

Subscribers can set global channel preferences, which override individual settings. For instance, if there are 10 workflows, and a subscriber wants to disable SMS notifications for all of them, they can do so with via global preferences.

## Subscriber channel preferences per workflow

For each workflow, subscriber has its own channel preferences. Subscriber can manage this preferences from the <Method href="/platform/inbox/react/components/preferences">{`<Inbox />`}</Method>{" "}Preferences view.

<Callout type="info">Inbox displays onlychannels present in the current workflow.</Callout>

## Priority of preferences

Since, there are three type of preferences, there is a priority of preferences. The priority is as follows:

Workflow channel preferences > Subscriber global preferences > Subscriber channel preferences per workflow

Examples:

1. If `email` channel is disabled in workflow channel preferences then it global and subscriber channel preferences will be ignored and subscriber will not receive email notifications from this workflow.
2. If `in-app` channel is enabled in the workflow channel preferences but workflow is marked as critical, then subscriber not be able to change the preferences for this workflow and will always receive in-app notifications from this workflow.
3. If `chat` is enabled and `email` is enabled in the workflow, `chat` is enabled and `email` is disabled in the subscriber global preferences, then subscriber will receive only chat notifications from this workflow
