import { TypeTable } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/type-table';

In Novu, we call the entities designed to receive notifications as `Subscribers`. Each subscriber is unique and identified by a unique subscriberId.

<Callout type="info">
  We recommend using the internal unique id your application uses for a specific user as the
  `subscriberId`.
</Callout>

Each subscriber has the following data points:

- **User Data** - Data stored in the subscriber object that you can easily access in your notification templates. This contains basic info such as first name, last name, avatar, locale, email, and phone. This data is fixed and structured.
- **Custom Data** - Apart from the above fixed structured user data, any unstructured custom data such as user's address, nationality, height, etc can also be stored in the `data` field using key-value pairs.
- **Channel Specific Credentials** - `deviceTokens` required to send push notifications and `webhookUrl` for chat channel providers can also be stored.

## Subscriber attributes

<TypeTable
  type={{
    subscriberId: {
      type: 'string',
      description: 'Unique identifier for the subscriber',
      default: undefined,
      typeDescription: 'Required',
    },
    firstName: {
      type: 'string',
      description: 'First name of the subscriber',
      default: undefined,
    },
    lastName: {

      default: undefined,
    },

      default: '{}',
    },
  }}
/>

## Creating a subscriber

We support creating new subscriber using two ways, `Just-in-time` means sending complete subscriber data in `to` field while triggering or `Ahead of Trigger` means adding subscribers before triggering notification.

### Just-in-time

A non-existing subscriber can be added by sending subscriber data in `to` field of the trigger method. If any subscriber with provided `subscriberId` does not exists, a new subscriber will be created. In this case, subscriber will be created first and then the trigger will be executed synchronously. If a subscriber with the provided `subscriberId` already exists and the data in `to` field of the trigger method is different from the data already stored in Novu, the subscriber will be updated with the new data and then the trigger will be executed synchronously.

```jsx title="Node.js"
import { Novu } from '@novu/api';

const novu = new Novu({
  secretKey: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE",
});

await novu.trigger({
  workflowId: '<WORKFLOW_TRIGGER_IDENTIFIER>',
  to: {
    subscriberId: "subscriber_unique_identifier",
    firstName: "Albert",
    lastName: "Einstein",
    email: "albert@einstein.com",
    phone: "+1234567890",
  },
  payload: {
    customVariable: 'variableValue',
    organization: {
      logo: 'https://organization.com/logo.png',
    },
  },
});
```

When triggering the workflow, you must specify all required `to` fields per the channels in the workflow. For example, if an email step is included in the workflow, then the `to.email` field must be specified. Similarly if an SMS step is included, the `to.phone` field must be specified.

#### Hydrating users data from database

If you are defining workflows with code using [@novu/framework](/framework/introduction), you can use the `subscriberId` to hydrate subscriber data directly from your database or other sources during workflow execution. This is useful when you don't want to store all the subscriber data in Novu.

Learn more about [@novu/framework](/framework/introduction) and how to use it to define workflows with code.

For example, you may have a welcome onboarding email that you trigger immediately after a user signs up, with the email only sent 1 hour after signup:

```typescript
import { workflow } from '@novu/framework';
import { userDb } from '../db/userDb';

export const welcomeEmail = workflow('welcome-email', async ({ step, subscriber }) => {
  await step.delay('delay', () => ({ amount: 1, unit: 'hours' }));

  await step.email('send-email', async (controls) => {
    // Fetch user data from your database in real-time to
    // ensure up-to-date information
    const user = await userDb.findById(subscriber.subscriberId);

    return {
      subject: `Welcome, ${user.firstName}`,
      body: 'Welcome to our platform!',
    };
  });
});
```

Then, when you trigger the workflow, you can pass the `subscriberId` and the workflow will fetch the user data from your database in real-time:

```typescript
await welcomeEmail.trigger({
  to: {
    subscriberId: '123',
    email: 'john.doe@domain.com',
  },
});
```

<Callout type="info">
It is possible for two subscribers to have the same email address in our system as `subscriberId` is the unique identifier that distinguishes one subscriber from another.
</Callout>

### Ahead of Trigger

Create the subscriber and then trigger the notification to this subscriber. Here `subscriberId` is the required field and other fields are optional.

```jsx
import { Novu } from '@novu/api';

const novu = new Novu({
  secretKey: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE",
});

await novu.subscribers.create({
  subscriberId: "subscriber_unique_identifier",
  firstName: "Albert",
  lastName: "Einstein",
  email: "albert@einstein.com",
  phone: "+1234567890",
  avatar: 'https://example.com/images/avatar.jpg',
  locale: 'en-US',
  data: { customKey1: 'customVal1', customKey2: 'customVal2' },
});

```

Novu will create a subscriber if one does not exist and will update the existing subscriber. You can call this function during registration or signup to make sure the subscriber data is up-to-date, if you wish to save additional attributes with a subscriber, you can pass additional custom data in the **data** field as key-value pairs.

## Bulk subscriber creation

You can create subscribers in bulk _(up to 500 at once)_ via the SDKs or [API](/api-reference/subscribers/subscribers-v1-controller_bulk-create-subscribers).

```typescript
import { Novu } from "@novu/api";

const novu = new Novu({
  secretKey: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE",
});

await novu.subscribers.createBulk({
  subscribers: [
    {
      subscriberId: "albert_einstein_user_id",
      firstName: "Albert",
      lastName: "Einstein",
      email: "albert@einstein.com",
      phone: "+1234567890",
      avatar: 'https://example.com/images/albert_einstein.jpg',
      locale: 'en-US',
      data: { isScientist: true },
    },
    {
      subscriberId: "nikola_tesla_user_id",
      firstName: "Nikola",
      lastName: "Tesla",
      email: "nikola@tesla.com",
      phone: "+1234567890",
      avatar: 'https://example.com/images/nikola_tesla.jpg',
      locale: 'en-US',
      data: { isInventor: true },
    }
  ],
});
```

## Manage subscribers from dashboard

Subscribers can be managed from the dashboard by navigating to the `Subscribers` page.
