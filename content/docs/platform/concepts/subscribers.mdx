import { TypeTable } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/type-table';

In Novu, we call the entities designed to receive notifications as `Subscribers`. Each subscriber is unique and identified by a unique subscriberId.

<Callout type="info">
  We recommend using the internal unique id your application uses for a specific
  user as the `subscriberId`.
</Callout>

Each subscriber has the following data points:

- **User Data** - Data stored in the subscriber object that you can easily access in your notification templates. This contains basic info such as first name, last name, avatar, locale, email, and phone. This data is fixed and structured.
- **Custom Data** - Apart from the above fixed structured user data, any unstructured custom data such as user's address, nationality, height, etc can also be stored in the `data` field using key-value pairs.
- **Channel Specific Credentials** - `deviceTokens` required to send push notifications and `webhookUrl` for chat channel providers can also be stored.

## Subscriber attributes

<TypeTable
  type={{
    subscriberId: {
      type: 'string',
      description: 'Unique identifier for the subscriber',
      default: undefined,
      typeDescription: 'Required'
    },
    firstName: {
      type: 'string',
      description: 'First name of the subscriber',
      default: undefined
    },
    lastName: {
      type: 'string',
      description: 'Last name of the subscriber',
      default: undefined
    },
    email: {
      type: 'string',
      description: 'Email address of the subscriber',
      default: undefined
    },
    phone: {
      type: 'string',
      description: 'Phone number of the subscriber',
      default: undefined
    },
    locale: {
      type: 'string',
      description: 'Locale preference of the subscriber',
      default: undefined
    },
    avatar: {
      type: 'string',
      description: 'URL to the subscriber\'s avatar image',
    },
    data: {
      type: 'object',
      description: 'Custom key-value pairs for additional subscriber data',
      default: '{}'
    }
  }}
/>

## Creating a subscriber

We support creating new subscriber using two ways, `Ahead of Trigger` means adding subscribers before triggering notification or `Just-in-time` means sending complete subscriber data in `to` field while triggering.

### Just-in-time

A non-existing subscriber can be added by sending subscriber data in `to` field of the trigger method. If any subscriber with provided `subscriberId` does not exists, a new subscriber will be created. In this case, subscriber will be created first and then the trigger will be executed synchronously.

```jsx title="Node.js"
import { Novu } from '@novu/api';

const novu = new Novu('<NOVU_SECRET_KEY>');

await novu.trigger({
  workflowId: '<WORKFLOW_TRIGGER_IDENTIFIER>',
  to: {
      subscriberId: '111',
      email: 'john.doe@domain.com',
      firstName: 'John',
      lastName: 'Doe',
      phone: '+13603963366',
  },
  payload: {
      customVariable: 'variableValue',
      organization: {
          logo: 'https://organization.com/logo.png',
      },
  },
});
```

When triggering the workflow, you must specify all required `to` fields per the channels in the workflow. For example, if an email step is included in the workflow, then the `to.email` field must be specified. Similarly if an SMS step is included, the `to.phone` field must be specified.

If you are defining workflows with code, you can use the `subscriberId` to hydrate subscriber data directly from your database or other sources during workflow execution. This is useful when you don't want to store all the subscriber data in Novu.
