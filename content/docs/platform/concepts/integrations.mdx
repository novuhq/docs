In Novu, integrations are configured connections to third-party services that deliver notifications across supported channels, which are email, SMS, push, and chat. The In-App channel is handled internally by Novu and does not require a third-party integration.

Each integration links Novu to a provider, and workflows use these integrations to route notifications to the correct service.

<Callout type='info'>Each integration is scoped to a specific environment. You must create and configure separate integrations for each environment (for example, development, staging, production).</Callout>

## Providers vs. Integrations

A provider is the third-party service (for example, SendGrid for email or Twilio for SMS), and an integration is a configured instance of that provider within Novu.

- One provider can have multiple integrations.
- Each integration has:
  - A unique, editable identifier.
  - An optional name, which is useful when you have multiple integrations from the same provider.

Refer to this resource to see the full list of [provider IDs used in Novu](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/26684f331c9c3ecf884f89f9e9b7fcb97d9ee2fb/packages/framework/src/shared.ts#L103).

<Callout type='info'>Novu also lets you use [Trigger Overrides](/platform/workflows/trigger-overrides) to modify the default behavior of a message during workflow trigger, such as overriding the message title or payload. This works alongside integrations to fine-tune delivery behavior. </Callout>

## Primary and active integrations

Each environment can support multiple active integrations per channel, but only one can be marked as the primary integration for email and SMS channels. However, for push and chat channels, all active integrations are used in parallel to deliver messages. 

The primary integration is used by default whenever a workflow sends a message for that channel.

You can:
- Set or change the primary integration via the dashboard or API.
- Disable an integration, which makes it inactive, meaning Novu will not use it for sending messages until it's re-enabled or replaced.

<Callout>If no active integration is available for a channel, Novu cannot send notifications for that channel. The corresponding workflow step will fail.</Callout>

## Integration credentials

Each integration requires a set of credentials, to authenticate with the third-party provider. Secret credentials such as API keys or tokens are encrypted at rest while non-secret fields such as sender name or from address are stored as plain text.

When setting up an integration, you may also need to provide:
- Sender information (for example, from address or phone number).
- Webhook support details (if applicable).
- Optional configuration settings depending on the provider.

## Integration store

You can manage integrations directly from the [Integration Store](https://dashboard.novu.co/integrations) in the Novu dashboard. 

From there, you can:

- Add new integrations by providing credentials and configuration values.
- Set a primary integration per channel.
- Enable or disable integrations as needed.
- Delete an integration (this action is permanent).

<Callout type='warn'>Workflow delivery will fail if you delete an integration that's still in use.</Callout>

## Available integrations

Novu supports a wide range of providers across different channels:
