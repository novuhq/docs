## Integrations

Integrations are what allow Novu to handle message delivery over multiple channels. Of the five notification channels that Novu currently supports, each channel except the 'in-app' channel has multiple providers.

### Integraton Store

You can configure your own integrations by visiting the [Integration Store](https://dashboard.novu.co/integrations). When connecting the integration you will be asked to provide the `credentials` and other optional configurations for the integration. All secret keys are encrypted before persisted to the database.

### Available Integrations

You can find the list of available integrations for each channel:
