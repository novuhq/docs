In Novu, integrations are configured connections to third-party services that deliver notifications across supported channels, which are email, SMS, push, and chat. The In-App channel is handled internally by Novu and does not require a third-party integration.

Each integration connects Novu to a specific provider, which workflows use to deliver notifications over the related channel.

<Callout type='info'>Each integration is scoped to a specific [environment](/platform/concepts/environments). You must create and configure separate integrations for each environment (for example, development, staging, production).</Callout>

## Providers vs integrations

A provider is the third-party service (for example, SendGrid for email or Twilio for SMS), and an integration is a configured instance of that provider within Novu.

- One provider can have multiple integrations.
- Each integration has:
  - A unique, editable identifier.
  - An optional name, which is useful when you have multiple integrations from the same provider. Novu uses the `providerId` as the default name. It is recommended to change the default name if you have multiple integrations from the same provider.

Refer to this resource to see the full list of [providerIds used in Novu](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/next/packages/framework/src/shared.ts#L103).

<Callout type='info'>Novu also lets you use [Trigger Overrides](/platform/workflows/trigger-overrides) to modify the default behavior of a message during workflow trigger, such as overriding the notification title or content, using different integration that primary integration. This works alongside integrations to fine-tune delivery behavior. </Callout>

## Primary and active integrations

Each environment can support multiple active integrations per channel, but only one can be marked as the primary integration for email and SMS channels. However, for push and chat channels, all active integrations are used in parallel to deliver messages. 

The primary integration is used by default whenever a workflow sends a message for that channel .

You can:
- Set or change the primary integration via the dashboard or API.
- Mark an integration as inactive, which means Novu will no longer use it to send messages until it is marked active again.

<Callout type="warning">If no active integration is available for a sms or email channel, Novu cannot send notifications for email and sms channels. The corresponding workflow channel step will fail.</Callout>

## Integration credentials

Each integration requires a set of credentials to authenticate with the third-party provider. Secret credentials, such as API keys or tokens, are encrypted at rest, while non-secret fields, such as the sender name or from address, are stored as plain text.

When setting up an integration, you may need to provide:
- Sender information (for example, from email address, sender name).
- Credentials such as API keys or tokens.
- Optional configuration settings depending on the provider.

Read [documentation](/platform/integrations/overview) for each provider to see the required credentials and configuration settings.

## Integration store

You can manage integrations directly from the [Integration Store](https://dashboard.novu.co/integrations) in the Novu dashboard. 

From there, you can:

- Add new integrations by providing credentials and configuration values.
- Set a primary integration per channel.
- Mark integrations as active or inactive as needed.
- Delete an integration, but if it’s currently set as the primary integration, you’ll be prompted to select another active integration to take its place.

## Available integrations

Novu supports a wide range of providers across different channels:
