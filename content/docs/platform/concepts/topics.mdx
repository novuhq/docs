In Novu, a _topic_ is a way to group subscribers under a shared label so that you can broadcast a message to many users with a single workflow trigger. This fan-out mechanism removes the need to manage individual subscriber IDs for each notification, streamlining scenarios like product announcements, feature rollouts, or status updates.

## Topics identifiers

Each topic is uniquely identified by a topic key, a permanent, internal reference in your system. You can also assign a name to help describe its purpose (for example, "Task Updates" or "Comment Thread Subscribers"). The topic key must be unique and cannot be changed after creation; Novu enforces this uniqueness behind the scenes.

Common use cases:
- Notifying all members of a specific team or project
- Messaging users who commented on a post
- Updating subscribers to a specific product or feature

## How topics fit into Novu's model

Novu’s notification system is built around workflows, which are triggered for one or more recipients. Topics act as a special type of recipient, representing a group of subscribers instead of an individual.

When you trigger a workflow using a topic:
- The to field accepts the topic’s key.
- Novu looks up all subscribers assigned to the topic.
- A separate workflow event is created for each subscriber for delivery and billing.

Topics let's you target large groups with a single API call, no need to loop through subscribers or send multiple workflow triggers.

## Dynamic and decoupled grouping

Once a topic is created, you can assign or remove subscribers at any time. Subscribers don’t need to know they belong to a Topic, it doesn’t affect their personal notification preferences.

Topics are dynamic and reflect real-time states. For example, a topic might include:
- All users watching a post (who can be removed if they unfollow)
- All team members on a project (who can change over time)

This makes topics especially useful for modeling dynamic relationships in your application.

## Scalability and limits

Topics are designed for high-volume, high-efficiency use cases:
- Each topic supports up to 100,000 subscribers
- A separate workflow event is created for each subscriber when a workflow is triggered to the topic

This ensures accurate delivery and billing while supporting massive audiences.

## Autogenerated topics

Novu supports on-the-fly topic creation. If you add subscribers to a non-existent topic, Novu will automatically create it using the given key. The topic will be named as the topic key, and can be renamed or managed later like any other topic.

## Frequently asked questions

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Do topics override subscriber preferences?">
    No. Topics only define delivery groups. Each subscriber’s individual notification preferences remain intact.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is a topic like a mailing list?">
  Conceptually, yes. Topics group users to receive shared messages. However, topics are more dynamic and integrated into your application logic.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can a subscriber belong to multiple topics?">
  Yes. Subscribers can be members of any number of topics. This allows overlapping targeting strategies (for example, `task-updates`, `project-X`, and `admin-notifications`).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I reuse the same topic key across environments?">
  Topic keys must be unique within each environment. You can reuse the same key (for example, `feature-release`) in different environments like staging and production.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if I trigger a workflow to a topic with no subscribers?">
  The workflow will still be processed, but no notifications will be delivered.
