In Novu, a _topic_ is a way to group subscribers under a shared label so that you can broadcast a message to many users with a single workflow trigger. This fan-out mechanism removes the need to manage individual subscriber IDs for each notification, streamlining scenarios like product announcements, feature rollouts, or status updates.

## Topics identifiers

Each topic is uniquely identified by a topic key, a permanent, internal reference in your system. You can also assign a name to help describe its purpose, for example, "Task Updates" or "Comment Thread Subscribers".

The topic key must be unique and cannot be changed after creation; Novu enforces this uniqueness behind the scenes.

Common use cases:
- Notifying all members of a specific team or project
- Messaging users who commented on a post
- Updating subscribers to a specific product or feature

## How topics fit into Novu's model

Novu’s notification system is built around workflows, which are triggered for one or more recipients. Topics act as a special type of recipient, representing a group of subscribers instead of an individual.

When you trigger a workflow using a topic:
- The to field accepts the topic’s key.
- Novu looks up all subscribers assigned to the topic.
- A separate workflow event is created for each subscriber for delivery and billing.

Topics let you target large groups with a single API call, no need to loop through subscribers or send multiple workflow triggers.

## Dynamic and decoupled grouping

Once a topic is created, you can assign or remove subscribers at any time. Subscribers don’t need to know they belong to a topic, and it doesn’t affect their personal notification preferences.

Topics are dynamic and reflect real-time states. For example, a topic might include:
- Users who are currently watching a post
- Team members assigned to a project

This makes topics especially useful for modeling dynamic relationships in your application.

## Scalability and limits

Topics are designed for high-volume, high-efficiency use cases:
- Each topic supports up to 100,000 subscribers
- A separate workflow event is created for each subscriber when a workflow is triggered to the topic

This ensures accurate delivery and billing while supporting massive audiences.

## Autogenerated topics

Novu supports on-the-fly topic creation. If you attempt to add subscribers to a topic key that doesn't exist for the selected environment and organization, Novu will automatically create a new topic named `Autogenerated-<TOPIC_KEY>` and assign the subscribers to it.

This auto-generated topic can then be renamed and managed just like any other topic created manually.

## Frequently asked questions

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Do topics override subscriber preferences?">
    No. Topics only define delivery groups. Each subscriber’s individual notification preferences remain intact.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is a topic like a mailing list?">
  Conceptually, yes. Topics group users to receive shared messages. However, topics are more dynamic and integrated into your application logic.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can a subscriber belong to multiple topics?">
  Yes. Subscribers can be members of any number of topics. This allows overlapping targeting strategies (for example, `task-updates`, `project-X`, and `admin-notifications`).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I reuse the same topic key across environments?">
  Topic keys must be unique within each environment. You can reuse the same key (for example, `feature-release`) in different environments like staging and production.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if I trigger a workflow to a topic with no subscribers?">
  The workflow are processed, but no notifications are delivered.
