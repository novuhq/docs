In Novu, notifications are the core building blocks of your product’s communication experience. When your user receives a message via an in-app alert, an email, or a push notification, what they’re seeing is the final output of a notification.

Notifications represent the complete journey of a message triggered by an event in your application and delivered to a specific user across one or more channels. They encapsulate all the execution logic and delivery metadata in a single traceable unit.

## Notification lifecycle

A notification doesn't exist in isolation, it’s the result of a sequence of interconnected entities working together. Here’s how it works in Novu:

### Event

Something meaningful happens in your application, such as a user signing up, a password reset being requested, or a comment being posted. You emit this event to Novu using the [Event Trigger API](/api-reference/events/trigger/post).

Each event contains:
- A name that maps to a specific workflow (user_signed_up)
- A payload with dynamic data
- One or more subscribers
- Optional overrides or metadata

This is how your application tells Novu, “It’s time to send something.”

### Workflow

Novu matches the incoming event to a predefined workflow. This workflow is your logic for determining:
- What channels to use (email, in-app, SMS, etc.)
- What message templates to render
- When and how messages should be sent

The workflow is where message personalization, conditional logic, and multi-channel orchestration happens.

### Notification

Once the workflow starts executing, Novu creates a notification for each subscriber involved. This notification acts as the central entity tracking everything that happens—every job, every message, every delivery status. It includes:

- The subscriber details
- The workflow run and template used
- The event payload
- Jobs executed
- Messages generated
- Status updates and errors

Think of it as the container for all activity triggered by a single event for a single user.

### Message

Each step in the workflow results in one or more messages. These are the actual pieces of content sent to users' emails, push notifications, SMS, and in-app alerts.

Messages are live entities, tracked in real-time, with full visibility into:

- Rendering logic
- Channel used
- Delivery status
- Provider responses or errors

<Callout>Each message has its own ID and status, and you can query it via the [Message API](/api-reference/messages/messages/get).</Callout>

## Notification structure

A notification in Novu is more than just a message, it’s a full record of what happened from the moment an event was triggered to when one or more messages were delivered or failed to deliver.

Each notification encapsulates a set of properties that describe its creation, context, execution, and result. These properties are essential for debugging, analytics, and tracking user communications.

### Notification properties

| Property        | Description                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `transactionId` | A unique identifier for this specific notification execution run. Useful for tracing across APIs and logs.                                  |
| `template`      | The workflow (template) that was executed. Defines the steps and channels used.                                                             |
| `subscriber`    | The user who received the notification. Includes subscriber ID and metadata.                                                                |
| `payload`       | Dynamic data passed in from the event, used to render personalized message content.                                                         |
| `jobs`          | A list of steps (jobs) that were executed as part of the workflow. Each job corresponds to a workflow action, for example, send email or run delay. |
| `messages`      | The individual messages generated for each channel. Contains delivery status, content, and provider response.                               |
| `status`        | The current execution state of the notification (`pending`, `completed`, `failed`, etc.).                                                   |

These fields are accessible via the [Notifications API](/api-reference/notifications/notifications/get) and are also displayed in the Novu dashboard’s Activity Feed for visual traceability.
