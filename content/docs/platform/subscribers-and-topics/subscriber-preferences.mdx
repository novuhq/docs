Novu provides a flexible system with multiple levels of preferences that dictate how and where a subscriber receives messages. These settings influence both the delivery channels and the types of notifications a subscriber will receive.

Subscribers can define how they want to receive notifications. These preferences influence both the delivery channels and the types of notifications a subscriber will receive.

Preferences can be managed in three ways:

- By the subscriber, using the [Inbox UI](/platform/inbox/configuration/preferences).
- By the organization owner, using the Dashboard.
- By developers, programmatically through the API.

Novu supports both global preferences and workflow-specific preferences for each subscriber. However, you can a subscriber preferences from the Novu dashboard.

## Global preferences

Global preferences act as a default "on/off" switch for a specific channel across all workflows. A subscriber can use this setting vai the Inbox component to unsubscribe from a channel like SMS or email entirely. 

For example, if a subscriber disables a channel globally, that channel will also be disabled for all workflows that use that channel, and vice versa, unless they override it on the workflow level. 

### Manage global preferences via dashboard

1. From the **Subscribers** page, click on a subscriber's profile.
2. Navigate to the **Preferences** tab.
3. Under the **Global Preferences** section, you can enable or disable channels.

## Workflow preferences

Workflow preferences provide a more precise control, letting subscribers customize their channel choices for specific workflows.

For example, a subscriber can choose to only enable in-app notifications for a particular workflow. This preference will be honored while their global settings remain intact.

<Callout>You can mark a workflow as critical in the workflow settings. This ensures the workflow will not appear in the subscriber's preference settings, and they will always receive notifications from it.</Callout>

## Managing Preferences in the Dashboard
- From the **Subscribers** page, select a subscriber and go to their Preferences tab.
- In the **Workflow Preferences** section, you will see a list of all workflows the subscriber is associated with.
- For each workflow, you can toggle individual channel preferences on or off.

## Managing Preferences via API

Developers can use the Novu API to manage a subscriber's preferences. This is useful for building custom preference centers within your application or for automated management based on user behavior.

### Retrieve Subscriber Preferences

To inspect a subscriber's current preferences, including their global settings and all workflow-specific overrides, you can retrieve their preferences via the API using the `list` method.

```ts
import { Novu } from "@novu/api";

const novu = new Novu({
  secretKey: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE",
});

async function run() {
  const result = await novu.subscribers.preferences.list("<subscriberId>");
  console.log(result);
}

run();
```

For full request and response schemas, see the [API Reference documentation](/api-reference/subscribers/retrieve-subscriber-preferences).

### Update Subscriber Preferences

You can use the API to update a subscriber's preferences. You can update global channel preferences or specific workflow preferences using the same endpoint.

```typescript
import { Novu } from "@novu/api";

const novu = new Novu({
  secretKey: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE",
});

async function run() {
  const result = await novu.subscribers.preferences.update(
    {
      channels: {
        email: { enabled: false }, // disable globally
      },
    },
    "<subscriberId>"
  );

  console.log(result);
}

run();
```

For full request and response schemas, see the [API Reference documentation](/api-reference/subscribers/update-subscriber-preferences).
