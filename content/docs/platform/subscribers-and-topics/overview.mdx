Subscribers and topics are the foundation of how Novu delivers notifications at scale. Subscribers represent the individual entities who will receive notifications, while topics provide a way to group multiple subscribers under a shared identifier.

Together, they allow you to deliver notifications both at the individual level and to dynamic groups, ensuring messages are routed and personalized correctly for every recipient.

## Subscriber ID and Topic Key

Each subscriber in Novu is uniquely identified by a `subscriberId`, which serves as the permanent reference for that subscriber across workflows, preferences, and activity history.

Similarly, each topic is uniquely identified by a `topicKey`, an internal, permanent identifier that cannot be changed after creation. A topic key ensures that groups of subscribers can always be referenced consistently, regardless of how the topic is named or described.

## Subscribers, topics and environment

Subscribers and topics are scoped to a specific environment. Novu uses isolated environments, typically Development, Production or Custom environments to separate testing data from live user data.

This means a subscriber created in the Development environment is a completely separate entity from a subscriber with the same `subscriberId` in the Production environment.

This isolation is crucial for safe testing, as it prevents accidental notifications from being sent to real users from your development or staging setups. To target a subscriber in a different environment, they must be created within that environment.
