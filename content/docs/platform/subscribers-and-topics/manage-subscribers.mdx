You can manage subscribers from the Novu Dashboard for manual operations or the Novu API for automated, large-scale management.

## Create a subscriber

A subscriber must exist before notifications can be sent. Subscribers can be created in two ways:

### Create subscribers via dashboard

You can create subscribers from the Novu dashboard and add user attributes or custom data for each subscriber.

To create a subscriber in the dashboard:
1. Sign in to the Novu dashboard.
2. Navigate to **Subscribers** page.
3. Click **Add subscriber** or **Create subscriber**.

4. Fill in the subscriber details such as `subscriberId` (required), first name, last name, email, phone number, and locale.
  ![Add a Subscriber](/images/manage-subscribers/add-subscriber.png)
  <Callout type="warn">The `subscriberId` can only the edited during creation and cannot be updated aftwards</Callout>
5. Click **Create subscriber** to save the subscriber profile.

### Create subscribers via API

You can create subscribers with the Novu API in three ways and add user attributes, custom data, and channel credentials.

#### Create subscribers just in time

Novu allows you to create a subscriber automatically at the moment a notification is triggered. If the subscriber doesn't already exist, then Novu uses the information provided in the workflow trigger to create the subscriber on the fly. If the subscriber exists, then Novu updates the stored data with the latest values.

This approach is useful when:

- Your system does not store subscriber profiles ahead of time.
- Notifications are sent during real-time events like sign-ups or transactions.
- You want to keep the creation and delivery logic tightly coupled.

```typescript
import { Novu } from "@novu/api";

const novu = new Novu({ secretKey: "<YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE>", });

async function run() {
  const result = await novu.trigger({
    to: {
      subscriberId: "subscriber_identifier",
      firstName: "Albert",
      lastName: "Einstein",
      email: "albert@einstein.com",
      phone: "+1234567890",
    },
    workflowId: "workflow_identifier",
  });

  console.log(result);
}

run();
```

#### Create subscribers ahead of trigger

You can create and store subscriber profiles ahead of time, typically during onboarding, registration, or data sync events. This approach allows you to manage subscriber preferences, enrich profiles, and inspect delivery readiness before any notification is triggered.

This approach is useful when:

- You want to decouple user creation from notification logic.
- You rely on persistent user data or prefer strict validation before delivery.
- You plan to use advanced segmentation or preference-based delivery.

```typescript
import { Novu } from "@novu/api";

const novu = new Novu({ secretKey: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE", });

async function run() {
  const result = await novu.subscribers.create({
    subscriberId: "<id>",
    firstName: "Albert",
    lastName: "Einstein",
    email: "albert@einstein.com",
    phone: "+1234567890",
  });

  console.log(result);
}

run();
```

For more information about creating subscribers ahead of trigger, refer to the [API Reference](/api-reference/events/trigger-event) documentation.

#### Create subscribers in bulk

For scenarios like data migration, syncing large lists, or preloading subscribers, Novu supports bulk creation. This is especially useful when integrating with existing systems or importing subscriber data from external sources.

```ts
import { Novu } from "@novu/api";
 
const novu = new Novu({
  secretKey: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE",
});
 
async function run() {
  const result = await novu.subscribers.createBulk({
    subscribers: [],
  });
 
  console.log(result);
}
 
run();
```

For more information about creating subscribers in bulk, refer to the [API Reference](/api-reference/subscribers/bulk-create-subscribers) documentation.

## Update subscriber profile

You can manually update a subscriber's profile from the Novu Dashboard or via the API. This is important for keeping subscriber information, such as standard user attributes, custom data, or channel credentials up-to-date.

### Update subscribers via dashboard

You can manually update a subscriber’s attributes and custom data from the Novu dashboard:
1. Sign into the Novu dashboard.
2. Open the **Subscribers** page.
3. Select the subscriber profile you want to update.
4. Edit structured attributes such as name, email, phone, or custom data.
5. Click **Save changes** to apply the updates.

<Callout type="info">Channel credentials (such as device tokens or webhook URLs) cannot be created or updated in the dashboard. These must be managed via the API.</Callout>

### Update subscribers via API

The Novu API lets you update subscriber profiles programmatically, including user attributes, custom data, and channel credentials.

#### Update subscriber profile

To update a subscriber's basic profile attributes like `firstName` or `email`, or to modify their custom `data` object, use the `subscribers.patch` method. This method updates only the fields you specify, leaving others untouched.

```typescript
import { Novu } from "@novu/api";
 
const novu = new Novu({ secretKey: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE" });

async function run() {
  const result = await novu.subscribers.patch("subscriber-id-123", {
    firstName: "Albert",
    lastName: "Einstein",
    data: {
      membershipLevel: "premium"
    }
  });
  console.log(result);
}
run();
```

#### Manage subscriber channel credentials

To deliver notifications to channels like push or chat, a subscriber's profile must contain the correct credentials (for example, deviceTokens or webhookUrl). Novu provides two methods to manage these credentials: update and append.

- The `update` method completely replaces the existing credentials for a given provider with the new data you provide. This is useful when you have a definitive, single source of truth for the credentials.
- The `append` method adds new credentials or updates existing ones without removing others. This is particularly useful for push notifications where a single user may have multiple devices.

```typescript
import { Novu } from "@novu/api";
 
const novu = new Novu({ secretKey: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE" });
 
// Example 1: Use `update` to replace existing credentials for a provider like Slack.
const result = await novu.subscribers.credentials.update(
  {
    providerId: "slack",
    credentials: {
      webhookUrl: "https://example.com/webhook",
      channel: "general",
    },
  },
  "<subscriberId>"
);

// Example 2: Use `append` to add a new device token for a push provider without overwriting existing ones.
const result = await novu.subscribers.credentials.append(
  {
    providerId: "expo",
    credentials: {
      deviceTokens: ["token1", "token2", "token3"],
      webhookUrl: "https://example.com/webhook",
    },
  },
  "<subscriberId>"
);
```

For more detailed information on request payloads and supported providers, refer to the [Update](/api-reference/subscribers/update-provider-credentials) and [Upsert](/api-reference/subscribers/upsert-provider-credentials) provider credentials API Reference documentation.

## Search subscribers

Novu provides a way to search for subscribers, which is useful for troubleshooting, auditing user data, or verifying profile information. You can search for subscribers using either the Novu Dashboard or the API.

### Search for subscribers via dashboard

From the **Subscribers** page in the Novu Dashboard, you can search for a subscriber by Subscriber ID, Email, Phone, or Name.  

![](/images/manage-subscribers/search-subscriber.gif)

### Search for subscribers via API

You can use the Search Subscribers API to look up subscribers.

```ts
import { Novu } from "@novu/api";

const novu = new Novu({ secretKey: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE", });

async function run() {
  const result = await novu.subscribers.search({
    email: "albert@einstein.com",
  });

  console.log(result);
}

run();
```

To learn more about searching for subscribers, refer to the [Subscribers API reference](/api-reference/subscribers/search-subscribers) documentation.


## Retrieve a subscriber

You can fetch a complete subscriber profile using their unique `subscriberId`. This is done using the `subscribers.get` method. This method takes the `subscriberId` as a single parameter and returns a full JSON object containing all of the subscriber's stored information.

```ts
import { Novu } from "@novu/api";

const novu = new Novu({ secretKey: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE", });

async function run() {
  const result = await novu.subscribers.retrieve("subscriber-123");

  console.log(result);
}

run();
```

To learn more about retrieving a subscriber information, refer to the [Subscribers API reference](/api-reference/subscribers/retrieve-subscriber-subscriptions) documentation.

## Delete a subscriber

Deleting a subscriber permanently removes their profile and all associated data, including preferences, activity history, and credentials. This action is irreversible.

### Delete a subscriber via dashboard

You can manually delete a subscriber’s from the Novu dashboard:

1. Sign in to the Novu dashboard.
2. Open the **Subscribers** page.
3. Select the subscriber profile you want to update.
4. Click **Delete subscriber**.
5. A modal will appear; click **Delete subscriber** again to confirm.

![Delete a subscriber](/images/manage-subscribers/delete-subscriber.gif)

### Delete a subscriber via API

You can delete a subscriber using the `subscribers.delete()` method. The call deletes the subscriber record associated with the given `subscriberId`.

```typescript
import { Novu } from "@novu/api";

const novu = new Novu({ secretKey: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE" });

async function run() {
  const result = await novu.subscribers.delete("subscriber-123");

  console.log(result);
}

run();
```

To learn more about deleting a subscriber information, refer to the [Subscribers API reference](/api-reference/subscribers/delete-a-subscriber) documentation.
