You can manage the members of your organization from the **Settings** page in your Novu dashboard. A team is a group of users (members) associated with your organization.

<Callout type="info">Every user can view members, but only owners can invite or manage members in your organization.</Callout>

## Invite a new member to your organization

1. In the dashboard, go to **Settings** > **Team**
2. Click **Invite**. You can do this from the **Members**, **Invitations**, or **Requests** tab.
3. Enter the member’s email address
4. (Optional) Assign a role to the new member. If no role is selected, then the member is assigned the **Viewer** role by default.
5. Click **Send invitation**.

The invited user appears under the **Invitations** tab until they accept. Once accepted, they automatically move to the **Members** tab.

## Add a verified domain for automatic or request-based onboarding

You can simplify member onboarding by allowing users with your organization's email domain to join automatically or request to join your Novu organization.

1. In the dashboard, go to **Settings** > **Organization**
2. Scroll to the **Verified Domains** section
3. Click **Add Domain**
4. Enter the email domain you want to verify (for example, `novu.co`)
5. Confirm the verification process, if prompted

Once added:
- Anyone who signs up using a verified domain can either join automatically or send a request to join, depending on your organization’s configuration
- These users are assigned the Viewer role by default

<Callout type="info">Only users with non-public domains (for example, not `gmail.com`) can be auto-joined. You must have at least one Owner from the domain before it can be verified.</Callout>

## Revoke a pending invitation

You can revoke an invitation if a user hasn't accepted it yet. Revoking an invite immediately makes the link invalid.

1. Go to **Settings** > **Team** in your Novu dashboard
2. Select the **Invitations** tab to view all pending invites
3. In the **Actions** column, click the **⋯** menu next to the user whose invite you want to revoke
4. Select **Revoke invitation**

<Callout type="info">You can still send a new invitation after revoking the previous one.</Callout>

## Manage join requests

Users with a verified email domain can request to join your Novu organization. Only Owners can approve or decline these requests.

1. Go to **Settings** > **Team** in your Novu dashboard.
2. Open the **Requests** tab.
3. Review the list of users who have requested to join your organization.
4. In the **Actions** column, click the **⋯** menu next to their name
5. Accept or decline their request.

Users who are approved will be added to your organization and assigned the Viewer role by default.

## Update a member's role

You can update a member's role to control what they can access and manage within your organization. Only Owners can change roles.

1. Go to Settings > Team in your Novu dashboard.
2. Select the Members tab.
3. Find the user whose role you want to change.
4. In the **Role** column, open the dropdown next to their current role.
5. Select a new role from the list of [available account roles](/platform/additional-resources/roles-and-permissions)

![Updating a member's role](/images/account/managing-members-update-roles.png)

<Callout type="info">The last owner of an organization cannot have their role changed. Every organization must have an owner.</Callout>

## Remove a member from your organization

You can remove members who no longer need access to your Novu organization. This action immediately revokes their access to your organization dashboard and signs them out. Only Owners can perform this action.

1. Go to **Settings** > **Team** in your Novu dashboard
2. Open the **Members** tab
3. Find the member you want to remove
4. Click the action menu (⋯) next to their name
5. Select **Remove member**
