<Callout>Subscription is avialable from v3.4 for the `@novu/react` and `@novu/js` packages.</Callout>

This quickstart shows how to render the subscription UI in your app. The subscription UI lets users subscribe to topics, define conditions, and manage how they receive notifications.

Refer to the [Manage subscriptions documentation](/platform/subscription/manage-subscriptions) to learn how to manage subscriptions without rendering the Subscription UI.

The <Method href="/platform/subscription/quickstart">{`<Subscription />`}</Method> component is designed to work within an existing Novu environment and uses the same provider and session context as the Inbox component.

## Create a topic

Subscriptions are managed at the topic level. Before rendering the subscription UI, make sure the topic already exists. You can create a topic in the Novu Dashboard or via the API.

Topics can represent any category of notifications, if you haven't created a topic yet, see the [Topics documentation](/platform/concepts/topics).

## Install `@novu/react`

Ensure you have the latest version of the `@novu/react` package installed in your project.

```bash
npm install @novu/react
```

## Initialize the Novu client

Wrap your app or the specific section where the subscription component would live with the `<NovuProvider>`. Configure the provider with your `applicationIdentifier` and the current user's `subscriberId`.

```tsx
import { NovuProvider } from '@novu/react';

const NOVU_CONFIG = {
  applicationIdentifier: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER',
  subscriberId: 'user-123',
};

function App() {
  return (
    <NovuProvider {...NOVU_CONFIG}>
      {/* Application content */}
    </NovuProvider>
  );
}
```

## Add the component

Place the <Method href="/platform/subscription/quickstart">{`<Subscription />`}</Method> component inside the provider. You must pass two required props:
- **topic**: The topic key.
- **identifier**: A unique identifier for this specific subscription instance.

```tsx
import { Subscription } from '@novu/react';

export const SubscriptionUI = () => {
  return (
    <Subscription
      topicKey="project-123"
      identifier="project-updates"
    />
  );
};
```

## Define preferences

By default, the component fetches all workflows associated with the topic. You can decide which workflows to show, rename them, or group them using the `preferences` prop.

```tsx
import { Subscription } from '@novu/react';

export const SubscriptionUI = () => {
  return (
    <Subscription
      topicKey="project-123"
      identifier="project-updates"
      preferences={["workflow-identifier-1", "workflow-identifier-2"]}
    />
  );
};
```

The <Method href="/platform/subscription/quickstart">{`<Subscription />`}</Method> component provides a complete, ready-to-use UI. If you need more control, you can build a [custom subscription](/platform/subscription/customize-the-ui) experience using the subscription components and hooks.
