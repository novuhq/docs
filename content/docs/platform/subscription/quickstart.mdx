<Callout>Subscription is avialable from v3.12.0 for the `@novu/nextjs`, `@novu/react` and `@novu/js` packages.</Callout>

This quickstart shows how to render the subscription UI in your app. The subscription UI lets users subscribe to topics, define conditions, and manage how they receive notifications.

<Callout>To learn how to render custom UI for the Subscription preferences, refer to the [Headless hooks documentation](/platform/subscription/Headless-hooks).</Callout>

The <Method href="/platform/subscription/quickstart">{`<Subscription />`}</Method> component is designed to work within an existing Novu environment and uses the same provider and session context as the Inbox component.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Create a topic

    Subscriptions are managed at the topic level. You can create a topic manually in the Novu Dashboard or via the API.
    
    However, you don't have to create it beforehand. If the topic key you provide to the component does not exist, Novu will automatically create it for you.

    Topics can represent any category of notifications. To learn more, see the [Topics documentation](/platform/concepts/topics).
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Install `@novu/nextjs`

    Ensure you have the latest version of the `@novu/nextjs` package installed in your project.

    ```bash
    npm install @novu/nextjs
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Initialize the Novu client

    Wrap your app or the specific section where the subscription component would live with the `<NovuProvider>`. Configure the provider with your `applicationIdentifier` and the current user's `subscriberId`.

    ```tsx
    import { NovuProvider } from '@novu/nextjs';

    const NOVU_CONFIG = {
      subscriber="SUBSCRIBER_ID"
      applicationIdentifier="APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER"
    };

    function App() {
      return (
        <NovuProvider {...NOVU_CONFIG}>
          {/* Application content */}
        </NovuProvider>
      );
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Add the component

    Place the <Method href="/platform/subscription/quickstart">{`<Subscription />`}</Method> component inside the provider. You must pass the `topicKey`. 
    
    The `identifier` prop is optional, you only need to provide it if you intend to manage multiple distinct subscriptions for the same topic.
    
    ```tsx
    import { NovuProvider, Subscription } from '@novu/nextjs';

    const NOVU_CONFIG = {
      subscriber="SUBSCRIBER_ID"
      applicationIdentifier="APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER"
    };

    function App() {
      return (
        <NovuProvider {...NOVU_CONFIG}>
          <Subscription
            topicKey="project-123"
            identifier="project-updates"
          />
        </NovuProvider>
      );
    }
    ```
  </Step>

</Steps>
