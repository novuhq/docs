## Overview

Layouts are reusable container for email content in Novu, designed to bring consistency, maintainability, and efficiency to your email communications. With layouts, teams can define shared elements (headers, footers, branding) and reuse them across multiple email steps and workflows.

Each environment includes one default layout, but you can create additional layouts based on your needs â€” such as transactional, marketing, or newsletter types.


**Important**: Every layout must include the `{{content}}` variable. This variable dynamically injects the content of the email step.

## Advantages of using layouts

- Reusable across workflows: One layout can be shared across many workflows and steps.
- Visual (Block) Editor: Drag-and-drop editor for building layout templates.
- Code Editor: Use raw HTML for fine-grained control.
- Environment Scoped: Each environment maintains its own set of layouts.
- Supports Variables: Use liquid variables like `{{subscriber.firstName}}` and `{{payload.orderId}}`

## Managing layouts

You can find layouts in the sidebar on Novu dashboard.

Here, you will see a list of existing layouts along with creation and editing options.

### Creating a layout

- Navigate to [Layouts page](https://dashboard.novu.co/layouts) on Novu dashboard.
- Click **Create layout** button on the top right corner.
- Fill in:
  - Layout Name - Human-readable name (e.g., "Newsletter Layout")
  - Identifier - Unique ID used internally and in APIs (e.g., newsletter-layout). This will be generated automatically if not provided.

A new layout is created with provider name and identifier.

### Writing layout content
Layout content can be written in two ways:

- Block Editor: Visual interface for building layout components. Add elements like headers, footers, images, and buttons by pressing `/` key.
- Code Editor: Write your layout using HTML.

Both the editors are similar in terms of features and capabilities as email step editor. Ensure your layout includes `{{content}}`, which acts as a placeholder for actual email content from the workflow.

Example HTML content:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>Welcome to Acme Inc.</h1>
    </header>

    {{content}}

    <footer>
      <p>Visit us at example.com</p>
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Editing the layout

- Navigate to [Layouts page](https://dashboard.novu.co/layouts) on Novu dashboard.
- Click on a layout from the list.
- Modify layout name or content using the editors
- Preview your layout with Preview Context, which allows you to test with mock subscriber data
- Click on the **Save** button to save your changes.
- If this layout is already in use, you will see a warning message.

A layout can be deleted or duplicated by clicking on the three dots and selecting the action.


## Using a layout in workflow email step

- Navigate to [Workflows page](https://dashboard.novu.co/workflows) on Novu dashboard.
- Select a workflow from the list.
- Select any email step of the workflow.
- Choose your layout from the Layout selector.

The selected layout wraps around the content written in the email editor.

### Previewing emails with layouts

Use the Test Workflow feature to preview how the email renders with actual subscriber data.
You can test different subscriber profiles and locales to validate the layout appearance.


## Tips of using layouts
- Use layouts for branding elements: logos, consistent colors, company details.
- Use the Block Editor for easier collaboration with non-technical teammates.
- Use the Code Editor when replicating an HTML design from Figma or another tool.
