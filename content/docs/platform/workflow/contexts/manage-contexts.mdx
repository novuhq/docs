Novu lets you manage contexts through the Novu dashboard, or the Novu API. This lets you create, view, update, and delete context entities to suit your application's needs.

<Callout type='warn'>You can pass a maximum of five contexts per workflow trigger and the serialized `data` object for each context is limited to 64KB.</Callout>

## Context object schema

When defining contexts, Novu supports multiple formats per key-value pair that let you store and reference metadata relevant to your workflows and templates.

Each context consists of:
- A `type` (for example, tenant, app, or region).
- An `id` that uniquely identifies the specific context instance.
- An optional `data` object that holds additional properties available to your templates.

Supported data formats include:

```typescript
await novu.trigger('welcome-email', {
  to: 'user123',
  payload: { userName: 'John' },
  context: {
    // Simple string format
    tenant: 'acme-corp', 
    
    // Rich object format (ID only)
    app: { id: 'jira' },                    
    
    // Rich object format (ID + data)
    region: {                               
      id: 'us-east',
      data: {
        name: 'US East',
        timezone: 'America/New_York',
        currency: 'USD'
      }
    }
  }
});
```

## Create a Context

You can create a new context via the Novu dashboard or API when you want to register reusable metadata. After creation, this context becomes available to all workflows and templates within your environment.

### Create a context via dashboard

Use the dashboard to manually define contexts that represent key business entities.

1. Log in to the Novu dashboard
2. Click **Contexts** on the sidebar.
3. Click **Create context**.
![create context](/images/workflows/contexts/create-context.png)
4. Complete the following fields:
    - **Identifier**: A unique identifier within that type (for example, acme-corp).
    - **Context type**: A category such as tenant, app, or region.
    - **Custom data (JSON)**: An optional JSON object that contains metadata, such as branding, plan, or region details.
5. Click **Create context** to save the context.

### Create a context via API

Novu provides an API to create a context. If a context with the same `type:id` combination already exists, then the request will fail.

```bash
POST /v2/contexts
{
  "type": "tenant",
  "id": "acme-corp",
  "data": {
    "name": "Acme Corporation",
    "plan": "enterprise"
  }
}
```

### Create a context via API (Just-in-time)

Contexts can also be created automatically when you trigger a workflow that includes a new context object. If the specified `type:id` doesn’t exist, then Novu automatically creates it before running the workflow.

```
await novu.trigger('welcome-email', {
  to: 'user@example.com',
  payload: { userName: 'John' },
  context: {
    tenant: 'acme-corp',   // Created automatically if it doesn’t exist
    app: 'jira'
  }
});
```

## Update a context

You can update a context’s data payload at any time. The context `type` and `id` remain immutable.

#### Update a context via dashboard

1. Log in to the Novu dashboard.
2. Click **Contexts** on the sidebar.
3. Click on the context you wish to edit from the context list on the Context page. 
4. Modify its data object in the UI.
5. Click **Save changes**.

### Update a context via API

Novu provides an API to update an existing context. The `data` object is replaced entirely during updates (not merged). Include all fields you want to retain.

```bash
PATCH /v2/contexts/tenant/acme-corp
{
  "data": {
    "plan": "premium",
    "region": "us-east"
  }
}
```

## Retrieve a single context

You can retrieve a context to verify its data, confirm its creation, or inspect the metadata it holds.

### Retrieve a context via dashboard

1. Log in to the Novu dashboard
2. Click **Contexts** on the sidebar to view the list of all existing contexts.
3. Click any context entry to see its details.

### Retrieve a context via API

Novu provides an API to retrieve a single, specific context by providing its `type` and `id` in the URL.

```
GET /v2/contexts/:type/:id
```

Here is an example:
```
GET /v2/contexts/tenant/acme-corp
```

## List or search for contexts

You can list all contexts in your environment or search for specific ones by context type or ID.

### List or search for contexts via dashboard

1. Log in to the Novu dashboard
2. Click **Contexts** on the sidebar to view all contexts.
3. Use the search bar to filter by context type or ID.

### List or search for contexts via API

Novu provides an API that lists or searches available contexts. Use pagination and search parameters to retrieve subsets efficiently.

```
GET /v2/contexts
GET /v2/contexts?search=acme
```

## Delete a context

Delete a context if it’s no longer needed. This action permanently removes the context from your Novu environment. 

<Callout type='warn'>This action cannot be undone, so ensure the context is no longer required by any active or historical workflows you might need to analyze.</Callout>

### Delete a context via dashboard

1. Log in to the Novu dashboard.
2. Click **Contexts** on the sidebar.
3. Click on on the context or on the **...** icon on the row of the context you want to remove.
4. Click **Delete context**, a menu will appear.
![Delete](/images/workflows/contexts/delete.png)
5. Click **Delete context**.
![Delete context](/images/workflows/contexts/delete-context.png)

### Delete a context via API

Novu provides an API that you can use to delete a context. Once deleted, the context will no longer be available for use in new workflow executions.

```
DELETE /v2/contexts/:type/:id
```

Here is an example:

```
DELETE /v2/contexts/tenant/acme-corp
```
