Contexts let you personalize how notifications are rendered and delivered by making contextual data available inside template editors, step conditions, and the <Method href="/platform/inbox/configuration/inbox-with-context">{`<Inbox />`}</Method> component.

## How to use context

Once a context is created either through the Novu dashboard or API, its data becomes available for use in your templates editors, step conditions, and for customizing the <Method href="/platform/inbox/configuration/inbox-with-context">{`<Inbox />`}</Method> component.

### Using context data in the template editor

Use the `{{context}}` Handlebars helper to access context data in any template editor. The context key you provide while creating the context (for example, tenant, region) becomes the accessor.


For example, if a context with this data is created:

```json
context: {
  tenant: {
    id: 'acme-corp',
    data: {
      name: 'Acme Corporation',
      plan: 'enterprise'
    }
  }
}
```

You can access the `name` and `plan` in your in-app, email, SMS, or push template like this:

```html
<p>Welcome, new user from {{context.tenant.data.name}}!</p>
<p>Your account is on the {{context.tenant.data.plan}} plan.</p>
```
Or

```text
Welcome, new user from {{context.tenant.data.name}}!
Your account is on the {{context.tenant.data.plan}} plan.
```

### Using context in step conditions

You can use context variables in the **Step conditions** tab of a workflow step to add conditional logic to your notifications. For example, only send a "Feature X is now enabled" email if `context.tenant.data.plan` is `enterprise`.

To learn how contexts are structured or how to define them, refer to the [Managing Contexts](/platform/workflow/contexts/manage-contexts) documentation.

## Viewing and debugging contexts

Once you start using contexts in your workflows, Novu provides full observability so you can monitor and debug your context usage after a workflow has been triggered.

### Searching for workflow runs

You can filter your workflow runs to find all executions associated with a specific context.

1. Navigate to the **Activity Feed** in your Novu dashboard.
2. Select the **Workflow Runs** tab.
3. In the search bar, click **Context** and enter the context `type` and `id` using the format `type:id`.

### Verifying the resolved context

To confirm that Novu received and processed your context data correctly, you can inspect the API traces for a specific run.

1. From the **Activity Feed**, select the relevant workflow run from the list in the **Requests** tab.
2. In the workflow run details, go to the **API Traces** tab.

Here, you will see the full context object that was resolved and attached to that specific workflow execution.
