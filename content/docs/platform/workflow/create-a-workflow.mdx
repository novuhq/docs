A workflow defines how Novu delivers notifications for a specific event. It contains the steps, templates, and rules that control how messages are sent across channels.

You can create workflows in the Dashboard or define them in code using the Novu Framework. This guide focuses on creating workflows in the Dashboard.

<Callout type="warn">Workflows can only be created and managed in the development environment. Once created, workflows can be synced to other environments. To learn more, refer to the [Environments](/platform/developer/environments#publishable-assets) documentation.</Callout>

## How to create a workflow

A Novu workflow can be created in the following ways:

- **Create from scratch**: Build a custom workflow tailored to your exact needs.
- **Create from template**: Start with pre-built workflows for common use cases.

### Create a workflow from scratch

1. Go to the <a href="https://dashboard.novu.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Novu Dashboard</a>.
2. Navigate to **Workflows**.
3. Click **Create workflow**.

4. Fill in the [workflow details](#workflow-details):
      - **Name** (Required)
      - **Identifier** (Required)
      - **Tags** (Optional)
      - **Description** (Optional)
4. Click **Setup** to enable translations. This is optional and doesn't affect workflow creation, you can configure translations later in the workflow editor. To learn more, refer to the [Translations](/platform/workflow/translations) documentation.
5. Click **Create workflow**

After creating the workflow, you’ll be redirected to the Workflow Editor, where you can configure the workflow and add steps.

### Create a workflow from a template

Templates are pre-built workflows for common notification scenarios. They include pre-configured steps, sample content, and pre-filled workflow detials that you can customize.

To create a workflow from a template:

1. Go to the Novu Dashboard.
2. From the **Workflows** page, you can access templates in two ways:
    - Click the dropdown on **Create workflow** and select **From template**.

    - Click **Explore templates**.

3. Select a template.
4. Click **Create workflow**.

## Workflow details

### Workflow identifier (`workflowId`)

Each workflow has a unique identifier used to reference it during API calls and event triggers. While the workflow name can be changed, the workflow identifier becomes immutable after creation.

Workflow identifiers must be a valid slug format (letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores only) and must be unique within one environment.

The `workflowId` is used to:
- Trigger workflows via the API.
- Conditionally display notifications based on workflow name or identifier.
- Reference workflows in during trigger overrides.

## Manage workflows

Once created, you can manage workflows from the Workflows page:

### Update a workflow

Click on any workflow to open the workflow editor, where you can:
- Update name and description (identifier cannot be changed)
- Add, remove, or modify tags.
- Change [workflow status](#).
- Configure [channel preferences](#) and [payload schema](#).
- Add, remove, or reorder [steps](#).

### Duplicate a workflow

1. Find workflow in Workflows page.
2. Click the three-dot menu (•••).
3. Select **Duplicate workflow**.
4. Provide new name and identifier.

5. Click **Duplicate Workflow**.

### Delete a workflow

This action permanently removes a workflow, cannot be undone. Existing triggers will fail with "workflow not found" error, however execution history is preserved for record-keeping in the Novu [Activity Feed](#)

Ensure the workflow is no longer being triggered in your codebase. Check for all references to the workflow identifier and remove or update them first.
1. Find workflow in Workflows page
2. Click the three-dot menu (•••)
3. Select **Delete**
4. Confirm deletion
