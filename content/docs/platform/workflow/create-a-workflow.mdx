A workflow defines how Novu delivers notifications for a specific event. It contains the steps, templates, and rules that control how messages are sent across channels.

You can create workflows in the Novu dashboard, using the [Novu API](/api-reference/workflows/create-a-workflow) or define them in code using the [Novu Framework](/framework/introduction#create-a-workflow). This guide focuses on creating workflows in the Novu dashboard.

<Callout type="info">Workflows can only be created and managed in the development environment. Once created, workflows can be synced to other environments. To learn more, refer to the [Environments](/platform/developer/environments#publishable-assets) documentation.</Callout>

## How to create a workflow

You can create a Novu workflow in the following ways:

- **Create from scratch**: Build a custom workflow tailored to your exact needs.
- **Create from template**: Start with pre-built workflows for common use cases.

### Create a workflow from scratch

1. Go to the <a href="https://dashboard.novu.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Novu Dashboard</a>.
2. Navigate to **Workflows**.
3. Click **Create workflow**.

4. Fill in the [workflow details](#workflow-details):
      - **Name** (Required): The display name shown in the dashboard. You can change this later in the workflow editor.
      - **Identifier** (Required): The `workflowId` is immutable. It must be in a valid slug format (letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores only) and must be unique within one environment.
        <Callout>The `workflowId` is required when [triggering events via the API](#) and when using [trigger overrides](#). It is also used to conditionally display notifications in the <Method href="/platform/inbox/overview">{`<Inbox />`}</Method>.</Callout>
      - **Tags** (Optional): Organize and categorize workflows. Tags can be added later in the workflow editor.
        <Callout>To learn more about Tags, refer to the [workflow tags](#) documentation.</Callout>
      - **Description** (Optional): Document the workflow’s purpose and behavior for your team. Description can be added later in the workflow editor.

4. Enable translations. This is optional and doesn't stop workflow creation and can be enabled after workflow creation in the workflow editor.
    <Callout>To learn more about translations, refer to the [Translations](/platform/workflow/translations) documentation.</Callout>
5. Click **Create workflow**.

After creating the workflow, you’ll be redirected to the Workflow Editor, where you can configure the workflow and add steps.

### Create a workflow from a template

Templates are pre-built workflows for common notification scenarios. They include pre-configured steps, sample content, and pre-filled workflow detials that you can customize.

To create a workflow from a template:

1. Go to the Novu Dashboard.
2. From the **Workflows** page, you can access templates in two ways:
    - Click the dropdown on **Create workflow** and select **From template**.

    - Click **Explore templates**.

3. Select a template.
4. Click **Create workflow**.

## Manage workflows

Once created, you can manage workflows from the Workflows page:

### Update a workflow

Click on any workflow to open the workflow editor, where you can:
- Update name and description (identifier cannot be changed)
- Add, or remove the workflow tags.
- Change [workflow status](#).
- Configure [channel preferences](#) and [payload schema](#).
- Add, remove, or reorder [steps](#).

### Duplicate a workflow

1. Find the workflow in Workflows page.
2. Click the three-dot menu (•••).
3. Select **Duplicate workflow**.
4. Provide new name and identifier.

### Delete a workflow

1. Find the workflow in Workflows page.
2. Click the three-dot menu (•••).
3. Select **Delete**.
4. Confirm deletion.

Deleting a workflow is permanent and cannot be undone. Any existing triggers referencing the deleted workflow will fail with a `workflow not found` error. Execution history is preserved in the [Novu Activity Feed]().
