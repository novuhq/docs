Each channel step in a Novu workflow comes with its own notification template. This template defines how notifications appear for a specific channel.

Quality templates are used to create personalized, visually appealing, and effective notifications.

- **Injecting variables from your trigger data into your notification template.**
- **Using Liquid syntax for logic and control flow within templates.**
- **Previewing and testing your notification templates.**

## Personalizing Notifications with Template Variables

To insert a variable into your Novu notification template, use double curly braces: `{{ variable_name }}`.

Novu templates allow you to reference several types of variables:

### Data payload variables

These variables originate from the data payload in your workflow trigger.
For example, if you include `{ "order_id": "12345" }` in your payload, you can reference it in your template as `{{ payload.order_id }}`.

### User properties

You can access user properties (like `firstName` or custom subscriber properties) using `{{ subscriber.* }}`. For instance:

```liquid
Hi {{ subscriber.firstName }},

You've been upgraded to the {{ subscriber.data.plan }} plan.

Thanks,
The Novu Team
```

## Variable Popover

When clicking on a variable in the template editor, a popover will appear. This popover can be used to easily manipulate the variable formatting by applying default values or Liquid Filters.

### Applying Liquid Filters

The variable popover will display a list of suggested Liquid Filters based on the variable type, you can apply one or more filters to the variable and re-order using drag and drop.
Re-ordering filters is useful as the filters are applied in the order they are listed, and the output of each filter is passed to the next one.

### Previewing filters output

With more advanced filter logic, you can preview the output of the filters by clicking on the **Preview** button and pass the variable value to see how the filters will be applied.

### Raw Liquid.js syntax

You can also apply raw Liquid.js syntax to the variable by clicking on the **Raw** button which will reveal the raw Liquid.js content that will be applied to the variable.

## Adding logic with Liquid Filters

Novu supports Liquid filters to add dynamic and conditional content to your notifications. Below are examples of how to use the top 10 Liquid filters in real-world notification templates.

```

**Output**:  
`Your subscription will renew on December 31, 2024.`

Use `truncate` to shorten long content like notification messages.

## Previewing and testing notification templates

When your notification template is ready, use the **Preview** mode to visualize how your notification will look. You can:

- **Test dynamic payload data:** Provide sample data to see how your template renders with different values.
- **Send test notifications:** Save your template, return to the workflow canvas, and run a test with real trigger data.
