Steps are the building blocks of a Novu workflow. Each step represents a distinct action or delivery mechanism that determines what happens, when it happens, and how a notification is delivered.

A workflow is built as a sequence of steps, executed from top to bottom. You define and arrange steps using the Workflow Editor in the Novu dashboard, where each node on the canvas represents a single step in the execution flow.

Each step operates independently. If one step fails, other steps in the workflow can still succeed, making workflows modular and fault-tolerant.

## Types of steps

Novu workflows support two types of steps from the Novu dashboard.

### Channel steps

Channel steps deliver notifications to users through supported communication channels. Each channel step includes its own template editor for defining notification content and channel-specific behavior.

Supported channel types include:

- In-App
- Email
- Push
- Chat
- SMS

In-app notifications are delivered directly to your application through the Novu <Method href="/platform/inbox/react/components/inbox">{`<Inbox />`}</Method>.

To send notifications through Email, Push, Chat, or SMS channels, you must configure the required [channel provider integration](/platform/integrations/overview) for your environment. Without an active integration, messages sent through that channel won’t be delivered.

<Callout>Novu provides built-in [demo integrations](/platform/integrations/demo-integration) for the Email and SMS channels. These sandboxed providers let you test workflows before configuring a provider.</Callout>

### Action steps

Action steps introduce logic and flow control into a workflow. They do not send notifications directly, but instead affect when and how downstream steps execute.

Action steps include:
- **[Delay](/platform/workflow/add-and-configure-steps/action-steps/delay)**: Pause workflow execution for a specified duration before continuing.
- **[Digest](/platform/workflow/add-and-configure-steps/action-steps/digest)**: Group multiple related events into a single notification.
- **[Throttle](/platform/workflow/add-and-configure-steps/action-steps/throttle)**: Limit how frequently notifications are sent for a workflow.

Action steps are typically placed before or between channel steps to shape delivery behavior.

<Callout>You can create custom stpes using Novu Framework. To learn more about, refer to the [Custom steps documentation](/framework/custom).</Callout>

## Add a step to a workflow

You add steps from the Workflow Editor when building or editing a workflow.

The first step in every workflow is the Workflow Trigger, which represents the event that starts the workflow.

To add steps:
1. Open a workflow in the Workflow Editor.
2. Click the **+** (Add step) icon at the desired position.
3. Select a step type from the available options.
4. Configure the step if required.

You can add multiple steps and reorder them at any time to change the execution flow.

## How steps execute

When a workflow is triggered:

- Steps execute sequentially, from top to bottom.
- Each step receives the same workflow payload.
- A step must complete before the next step begins.

This execution model allows you to build complex notification sequences that adapt to timing, user behavior, and delivery requirements such as:

1. Send an in-App message. 
2. Wait 24 hours (Delay). 
3. If the in-app message is unread, send an email. 
4. If the subscriber is a premium user, then follow up with an SMS message. 

This allows Novu workflows to adapt to user behavior and preferences while keeping the configuration visual and testable.
