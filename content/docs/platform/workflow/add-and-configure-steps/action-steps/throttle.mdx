After adding a Throttle step to a workflow, It limits the number of times a workflow is allowed to continue within a specified time window b. Once the execution limit is reached, the workflow stops at the Throttle step and downstream steps are skipped.

This page focuses on how to configure the Throttle step.

<Callout>To learn about the when to use Throttle in a workflow, refer to the [Throttle step overview](/platform/workflow/add-and-configure-steps/action-steps/throttle).</Callout>

## Throttle window

The Throttle window defines the time period in which executions are counted. Within this window, only the specified number of executions are allowed.

In the Throttle step properties panel, you will find the options to set your Throttle Window. You can choose between two main modes:

- Fixed: Select this option to configure a predefined time window using the Throttle for and Execution threshold fields.
- Dynamic: Select this option to use a window defined in your trigger payload. You will then configure the Dynamic window key to specify which payload variable to use.

### Fixed window

In fixed window, the time frame is predefined in the workflow editor. Use this mode when the time window for throttling is constant and known in advance. For example, "allow only one login alert per hour."

- **Throttle for**: Sets the fixed duration of the time window. The minimum duration is one minute. You can set this in minutes, hours, or days.
- **Execution threshold**: Defines the maximum number of workflow executions allowed within the specified time window. This defaults to 1.
- **Group throttling by**: By default, all throttling is grouped by the `subscriberId`. This field allows you to add a second aggregation key based on a variable from your trigger `payload`. This is useful for creating more throttling rules.

Here is an example of how they work together: 

Imagine you want to send a notification for each project a user belongs to, but no more than once a week per project. You can set `Throttle for` to "7 days" and `Group throttling by` to `payload.projectId`. This ensures the user receives one alert for Project A and one for Project B within the same week, instead of just one alert total.

### Dynamic window

In dynamic window, the time frame is determined by data sent in the trigger payload. Use this mode when the throttle duration or end time needs to be flexible and defined at the time of the trigger. For example, "throttle billing alerts until the end of the current billing cycle."

- **Dynamic window key**: Specify the key in your trigger payload that contains the dynamic window configuration. For example, `payload.throttleUntil` or `payload.customWindow`. 

    The value for the dynamic window key can be provided in one of two formats:
    1. **ISO-8601 Timestamp (string)**:
    This format throttles executions until a specific future date and time. Any new triggers before this timestamp will be evaluated against the throttle limit.

          ```json
          {
            "throttleUntil": "2025-10-31T23:59:59Z"
          }
          ```
    2. **Duration object**: This format throttles executions for a duration relative to the time of the first trigger. It follows the same structure as the fixed window configuration.

          ```json
          {
            "customWindow": { "amount": 30, "unit": "minutes" }
          }
          ```

- **Execution threshold**: Works the same as in the fixed window mode.

- **Group throttling by**: This also functions identically to the fixed window mode.
