The Delay step pauses workflow execution for a specified duration before continuing to the next step. This is useful use cases such as:

- Waiting for X amount of time before sending the message
- Wait for a short period of time before sending a push message in case the user seen the notification in the Inbox Component
- Send a reminder email 24 hours after a user abandons their shopping cart to encourage checkout completion
- Send a follow-up message 3 days after user registration to check if they need onboarding assistance

## Adding a delay step

You can add a delay step anywhere in a workflow—before or after any other step. When the workflow reaches the delay step, execution pauses for the configured duration and then resumes with the next step.

It is important to note that:

- You can apply step conditions to skip the delay when certain conditions are met.
- Delay steps can respect a subscriber’s delivery schedule. When enabled, notifications sent after the delay will be delivered during the subscriber’s next available time slot.
- Notifications sent after a delay are delivered based on the subscriber’s time zone if a `timezone` attribute is set. If not, UTC is used.

## Delay types

Delay types are used to define how long the workflow execution should be delayed before proceeding. These delay types are:

### Fixed delay

A fixed delay pauses workflow execution for a static duration. Use this when the delay length is known in advance and does not change.

You can specify fixed delays in seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, or months.

### Scheduled delay

A scheduled delay pauses workflow execution until a specific date and time, based on the subscriber’s time zone.

You can configure scheduled delays to resume execution:

- until minute.
- until hour at specific minutes.
- until day at specific hour and minutes.
- until week and days of the week at specific hours and minutes.
- until month on specific days of the month and weekdays at hours and minutes.

In the example above, the scheduled delay pauses workflow execution until the current day at either 10:00 AM or 11:00 AM, at 23, 24, or 25 minutes past the hour, based on the subscriber’s time zone.

### Dynamic delay

A dynamic delay also called a variable-based delay determines the delay duration using a variable from the event payload. This allows the delay to change per workflow execution.

The variable can be defined in one of the following formats:

- **ISO-8601 timestamp**: Example: `2025-01-01T12:00:00Z`. This value should be for future date and time.
- **Duration object**: Example: `{ "amount": 30, "unit": "minutes" }`. This value should be for future date and time. Here *amount* is the number of units to delay and *unit* is the time unit. *unit* can be **seconds**, **minutes**, **hours**, **days**, **weeks**, or **months**.

![Dynamic delay example](/images/platform/workflow/delay/dynamic-delay.png)

In this example, the `delayTill` variable is used to pause the workflow until the future date and time specified in the `delayTill` variable. 

<Tabs items={['ISO Date', "Duration object"]}>
  <Tab value="ISO Date">
   
    ```json
    {
      "delayTill": "2026-01-01T12:00:00Z"
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Duration object">
   
    ```json
    {
      "delayTill": {
        "amount": 30,
        "unit": "minutes"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

If a dynamic delay using an ISO date is added as the first step in a workflow, it effectively schedules the workflow execution to start at the specified time.

## Frequently asked questions

### If delay step fails, will the workflow continue to the next step?
No, workflow execution will stop immediately if the delay step fails due to an error. Common errors are:

- Invalid ISO date format
- Invalid duration object format
- Past datetime is specified
