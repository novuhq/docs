After adding a Delay step to a workflow, it pauses workflow execution for a specified duration or until a scheduled time, then resumes execution with the next step. You can add a Delay step anywhere in a workflow, before or after any other step to control when subsequent steps run.

This page focuses on how to configure the Delay step for your use case.

## Delivery behavior and scheduling

Delay supports delivery aware execution:
- Notifications sent after a delay can respect a subscriber’s delivery schedule.
- Notifications are delivered using the subscriber’s time zone if a `timezone` attribute is set.
- If no time zone is available, UTC is used.

## Adding a delay step

You can add a delay step anywhere in a workflow, before or after any other step. When the workflow reaches the delay step, execution pauses for the configured duration and then resumes with the next step.

## Delay types

Delay types are used to define how long the workflow execution should be delayed before proceeding. These delay types are:

### Fixed delay

A fixed delay pauses workflow execution for a static duration. Use this when the delay length is known in advance and does not change.

You can specify fixed delays in seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, or months.

### Scheduled delay

A scheduled delay pauses workflow execution until a specific date and time, based on the subscriber’s time zone.

You can configure scheduled delays to resume execution:

- until minute.
- until hour at specific minutes.
- until day at specific hour and minutes.
- until week and days of the week at specific hours and minutes.
- until month on specific days of the month and weekdays at hours and minutes.

In the example above, the scheduled delay pauses workflow execution until the current day at either 10:00 AM or 11:00 AM, at 23, 24, or 25 minutes past the hour, based on the subscriber’s time zone.

### Dynamic delay

A dynamic delay also called a variable-based delay determines the delay duration using a variable from the event payload. This allows the delay to change per workflow execution.

The variable can be defined in one of the following formats:

- **ISO-8601 timestamp**: Example: `2025-01-01T12:00:00Z`. This value should be for future date and time.
- **Duration object**: Example: `{ "amount": 30, "unit": "minutes" }`. This value should be for future date and time. Here *amount* is the number of units to delay and *unit* is the time unit. *unit* can be **seconds**, **minutes**, **hours**, **days**, **weeks**, or **months**.

![Dynamic delay example](/images/platform/workflow/delay/dynamic-delay.png)

In this example, the `delayTill` variable is used to pause the workflow until the future date and time specified in the `delayTill` variable. 

<Tabs items={['ISO Date', "Duration object"]}>
  <Tab value="ISO Date">
   
    ```json
    {
      "delayTill": "2026-01-01T12:00:00Z"
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Duration object">
   
    ```json
    {
      "delayTill": {
        "amount": 30,
        "unit": "minutes"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

If a dynamic delay using an ISO date is added as the first step in a workflow, it effectively schedules the workflow execution to start at the specified time.

## Extend to subscriber’s schedule

When enabled, delayed execution respects the subscriber’s delivery schedule.

If the delay completes outside the subscriber’s available delivery window, execution resumes during the next available time slot. This option is disabled by default.

## FAQs

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion title="If delay step fails, will the workflow continue to the next step?">
  No, workflow execution will stop immediately if the delay step fails due to an error. Common errors are:
  - Invalid ISO date format.
  - Invalid duration object format.
  - Past datetime is specified.
