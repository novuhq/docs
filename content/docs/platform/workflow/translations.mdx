## Workflow translations

Novu supports multi-language translations for workflows, allowing your notifications to dynamically adapt to your users' preferred language. This documentation covers everything you need to know to enable, configure, and manage translations for your workflows.

<Callout type="info">
  The translations feature is currently in `beta` and is available for `Team` and `Enterprise` plans.
</Callout>

Workflow translations allow each notification workflow, such as onboarding, password reset, and one time password (OTP), to support multiple locales. When a subscriber receives a notification, Novu selects the appropriate translation based on the subscriber's locale.

This feature helps teams:

- Reach users in their native language.
- Customize language per workflow or layout.
- Reduce friction in communication across geographies.

You can manage translations on the[translation page](https://dashboard.novu.co/translations) on Novu dashboard. Select the default language and add the target languages that you wish to support.

## Enabling translations

To use translations for a workflow, you need to enable them on the workflow level.

### While creating a new workflow

- Turn on the **Enable Translations** toggle
- Set the default locale, such as `en_US` or `en_GB`
- Add the target locales you wish to support, such as `fr_FR`, `es_ES`, `ja_JP`

### While editing an existing workflow

- Open an existing workflow
- Turn on the **Enable Translations** toggle
- You don't need to take any action if the toggle is already on

You can configure the default and targeted locales on the [translation page](https://dashboard.novu.co/translations).

## Translation groups
A translation group contains all language variants for a workflow identified by a unique workflow ID.

You can:

- Search for groups on the translations page
- View status per locale ('Outdated' or 'Up to date')
- Import or export translations for a specific locale, such as `en_US
- Import or export translations for all workflows where translations are enabled

## Translation JSON format

Each locale supports JSON-based translation files. For example, the `en_US.json` file contains the default translations for the workflow. You can update the translation JSON files using the JSON editor on the translation page.

```json
{
  "in-app": {
    "title": "Welcome to Novu!",
    "message": "Hi {{subscriber.firstName}}, let's get started!"
  },
  "email": {
    "subject": "Get Started",
    "body": "Thank you for joining us, {{subscriber.fullName}}"
  }
}
```

You can update translations by editing the JSON files in the editor on the translations page or by exporting and re-uploading them.

## Exporting and importing translations

If you prefer to create/update translations in a JSON file outside of the Novu dashboard, you can do so by exporting and importing them.

### Export

- Navigate to the translations page.
- Select the workflow you want to export translations for.
- Click on the locale, such as `en_US`, now click on the download icon to download the latest default locale translation JSON file.

### Import

- Navigate to the translations page.
- Select the workflow you want to import translations for.
- Click on the locale, such as `en_US`, now click on the **Import Language(s)** button to upload the translation JSON file.
- Novu detects the locale automatically using the file name

ðŸ’¡ Translation changes in default locale such as `en_US` will mark other locales as *Outdated, needs update*

### Master JSON file

Master JSON file is a JSON file that contains the default locale' translations keys of all the workflows where translations are enabled. You can import or export this file from the translations page. Below is an example of a master JSON file:

```json
{
  "workflows": {
    "events-publish": {
      "key": "value"
    },
    "events-update": {
      "subject": "A new update",
      "content": "{{payload.eventName}} event has been updated"
    }
  }
}
```

## Using translation keys in step content editor

In Email or In-App editors, use `{{t.key}}` to insert a translatable string. If the key already exists for the locale, it appears in the suggestions list.

Clicking **Add to Translations** automatically adds a new key to default locale.

Example:

```html
{{t.subject}} â†’ "Let's get you started"

{{t.product.details.description}}
```

## Testing translations

Use the Preview Context to:

- Simulate subscriber locale such as `fr_FR` or `ru_RU`
- Preview step content for the selected language.
- Update or correct missing translations on the fly.

## Keeping translations up to date

Any edit to the default locale will invalidate others. Youâ€™ll see a warning: `Outdated, needs update`. Re-export the default, update translated files, and re-upload.

## Disabling Translations

A translation group can be disabled by clicking on the three dots and selecting **Disable & delete translations**. This action is irreversible and removes all associated translation data.

## Translation in Layouts
This feature is currently a work in progress. If you need translation support in email layouts, reach out to us at support@novu.co


## Best practices

- Always finalize your default content before exporting.
- Avoid hardcoded language in the content editor.
- Use variables and translation keys consistently.
- Set subscriber locale properly to deliver notifications in the correct language.
