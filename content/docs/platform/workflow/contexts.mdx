Contexts are flexible, user-defined data objects that help you organize and personalize your notifications. They let you attach metadata (such as tenant, region, or app details) and enable contextual behavior to workflows, notifications, and other entities across Novu.

Think of it as a payload that isn't tied to a single workflow run, enabling you to organize, customize, and route notifications based on broader application scenarios like the tenant, application, or region that initiated the workflow.

In simple terms, a Context acts like an extended version of the payload. While the payload exists only for the duration of a single workflow execution, Contexts are persistent and can be reused across multiple workflows or API calls. This makes them ideal for multi-tenant environments, dynamic branding, and use cases where notifications depend on shared or reusable data.

<Callout type='warn'>You can pass a maximum of 5 contexts per workflow trigger and the serialized `data` object for each context is limited to 64KB.</Callout>

## How Context works

Imagine you have a single subscriber entity, `john@acme.com`, who uses two different applications you offer: "Notion Email" and "Notion Calendar". You want to send notifications specific to each application.

Without Context, you might have to create two different subscribers or use workarounds with subscriber ID prefixes to differentiate the notifications.

```javascript
// Problem: How does Novu know which app is sending the notification?

// Notion Email notification
await novu.trigger('new-email-received', {
  to: 'john@acme.com',
  payload: { title: 'You have 1 new email' }
});

// Notion Calendar notification  
await novu.trigger('new-calendar-event', {
  to: 'john@acme.com',
  payload: { title: 'You have a new meeting invite' }
});
```

With Context, you can provide this metadata directly in the trigger. This allows you to use a single workflow and subscriber entity, while dynamically changing content or logic based on the context.

```javascript
// Solution: Pass an 'app' context to differentiate triggers.

// Notion Email notification
await novu.trigger('new-email-received', {
  to: 'john@acme.com',
  payload: { title: 'You have 1 new email' },
  context: {
    app: 'notion-email',
    branding: {
      logo: "url_for_email_logo.png"
    }
  }
});

// Notion Calendar notification  
await novu.trigger('new-calendar-event', {
  to: 'john@acme.com',
  payload: { title: 'You have a new meeting invite' },
  context: {
    app: 'notion-calendar',
    branding: {
      logo: "url_for_calendar_logo.png"
    }
  }
});
```

You can then access this data within your workflow templates and conditions using variables like `{{context.app}}` or `{{context.branding.logo}}`.

## How to use Context in workflows

Once a context is created, you can access its properties anywhere variables are supported, such as in template editors or condition steps.

## Managing Context

You can create and manage Contexts through the Novu dashboard, the API or passing them directly when triggering a workflow. Once attached, their values can be accessed anywhere Novu supports variables, for example, in templates, step conditions, or layouts.

### Create Context

You can create a new Context via Novu dashboard or API, when you want to register reusable metadata. After creation, this context becomes available to all workflows and templates within your environment.

#### Dashboard

Use the dashboard to manually define contexts that represent key business entities.

1. Log in to the Novu dashboard
2. Click **Contexts** on the sidebar.
3. Click **Create context**.
4. Fill in the following fields:
    - **Identifier**: A unique identifier within that type (for example, acme-corp).
    - **Context type**: A category such as tenant, app, or region.
    - **Custom data (JSON)**: An optional JSON object that contains metadata, such as branding, plan, or region details.
  5. Click **Create context** to save the context.

#### API

You can create a context by sending a **POST** request. If a context with the same type:id combination already exists, the request will fail.

```bash
POST /v2/contexts
{
  "type": "tenant",
  "id": "acme-corp",
  "data": {
    "name": "Acme Corporation",
    "plan": "enterprise"
  }
}
```

#### Just-in-Time

Contexts can also be created automatically when you trigger a workflow that includes a new context object. If the specified `type:id` doesn’t exist, Novu automatically creates it before running the workflow.

```
await novu.trigger('welcome-email', {
  to: 'user@example.com',
  payload: { userName: 'John' },
  context: {
    tenant: 'acme-corp',   // Created automatically if it doesn’t exist
    app: 'jira'
  }
});
```

### Update a Context

You can update the data payload of any existing context. The content type and identifier are immutable.

### Delete a Context

You can delete a Context if it’s no longer relevant to your workflows. Deleting a context permanently removes it from your Novu environment.
