The workflow Editor is a robust visual tool that empowers both no-code users and developers to design advanced notification workflows. It seamlessly combines the intuitive simplicity of no-code building blocks with the adaptability and precision of code-based customization.

## What is a workflow?

A workflow in Novu is a container for all notification/message logic and templates within your system.

Each workflow:

- Has a unique identifier (key)
- Executes for one subscriber at a time (e.g. end user, recipient, customer, etc.)
- Contains complete notification/message logic and templates
- Supports subscriber preference management
- Can be triggered via API calls, events, or scheduled operations
