Novu uses environments to separate your workflows and it's data. This lets you safely test changes, like a new workflow, in one environment before moving it to a live production environment.

## Types of environments

When you create a Novu account, you are provided with a development and production environment by default. You can also create custom environments (on certain plans) to match your team’s workflow.

- **Development environment**: Use the development environment to build and test new workflows, layouts, translations, and experiment with different configurations before publishing to other environments.

- **Production environment**: The production environment is used to send notifications to your subscribers. To ensure stability and prevent unintended changes, this environment is view-only for workflows, layouts, and translations. Changes are not made here directly, they are made from other environment and then published to this production environment.

- **Custom environment**: Custom environments are only available on <a href="https://novu.co/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Team and Enterprise plans</a>. You can use them to reflect your release process, for example, staging or QA.

## Creating a custom environment

To create a custom environment:

1. Log in to the Novu dashboard.
2. Go to the [Environments page](https://dashboard.novu.co/environments) in Novu dashboard
3. Click **Create environment**. A menu appears. 
4. A menu will appear. Enter your preferred environment name.
5. Assign unique colors to easily distinguish between environments.

6. Click on **Create environment** button on the bottom right.
7. New environment will be created and will be available in the environments list.

## What's unique to each environment?

Each environment in Novu has it's own isolated resources, while the development environment has assets that can be published to other environments.

Each environment maintains some isolated set of resources, while you can share or promote other assets through publishing.

### Environment specific resources

These resources are completely separate and unique to each environment. Data in one environment has no connection to data in another. They are:

- Subscribers
- Topics
- Integrations (Provider credentials)
- API keys (application identifier and secret key)
- Activity feed
- Webhooks

### Publishable assets

These assets are managed centrally in the development environment and then published to other environments.
- Workflows
- Layouts
- Translations

### Environment credentials

Each environment has two unique identifiers:

1. **Application Identifier**

   - Public ID for client-side apps
   - Used with <Method href="/platform/inbox/overview">{`<Inbox />`}</Method>
   - Different for each environment
   - Safe to expose in frontend code

2. **API Secret Key**
   - Used for backend API authentication
   - Keep this secure and never expose publicly
   - Different for each environment

<Callout>Configure these credentials in your application based on the active environment, similar to how you manage other service credentials.</Callout>

## Publishing changes to other environments

Novu provides a publish mechanism that allows you to promote changes from your development environment to production or other custom environments. This process ensures that all changes are deliberate, reviewed, and deployed in a controlled manner.

The publishing process bundles all modifications made to workflows, layouts, and translations since the last publish event.

You can promote changes to other environments by following these steps:

1. Ensure you are in the **Development** environment. All changes must originate from here.
2. Click the **Publish changes** button in the top right of the screen.
