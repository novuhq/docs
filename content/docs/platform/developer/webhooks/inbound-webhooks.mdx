Inbound webhooks let Novu receive and process real-time events sent by third-party providers such as SendGrid, Amazon SES, Mailgun, and Resend. These events describe what happens to notifications after they are sent by Novu, such as, when an email is delivered, opened, clicked, or bounced.

When Novu receives an inbound webhook event, it:
- Parses and normalizes the provider’s event into Novu’s internal status model.
- Updates the message entity and step-run trace, so the event is visible in the activity feed.
- Forwards supported events to outbound webhooks if they are enabled in your project.
- Enriches the notification lifecycle with engagement and delivery data, which can also power analytics and workflow variables.

With inbound webhooks enabled, you get a full picture of the notification lifecycle, not just that a message was “sent,” but whether it reached the recipient, was opened, or engaged with. This closes the feedback loop and allows you to build more reliable notification experiences.

## How to enable the inbound webhook

First [create the integration](/platform/integrations/email/adding-email). After that, you can enable inbound webhooks by following these steps:
1. Navigate to the Integrations Store page from the sidebar of your Novu dashboard.
2. Click **Connect Provider** and select the email provider you want to configure.
3. Scroll down to find the **Email Activity Tracking** section and click the toggle to enable it.

When enabled, Novu will auto-configure delivery webhooks using your existing API key.

Inbound webhooks connect your provider’s event stream with Novu’s event processing system. Once enabled, Novu automatically creates and manages webhook endpoints with supported providers (such as SendGrid or Mailgun) so that delivery and engagement events can flow back into your Novu project.

## Event semantics in Novu

Inbound webhook events are normalized into a consistent set of Novu event statuses. These statuses let you track the full lifecycle of a notification across providers in a unified way.

| Novu status    | Meaning                                                                               |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sent`         | The provider has accepted the message for delivery.                                   |
| `delivered`    | The provider confirmed that the message was delivered to the recipient’s server.      |
| `opened`       | The recipient opened the message (tracked via the provider’s open logic).             |
| `clicked`      | The recipient clicked a link inside the message.                                      |
| `bounced`      | The message was rejected by the recipient’s server (hard or soft bounce).             |
| `rejected`     | The provider could not send the message (for example, invalid address, failed policy check). |
| `delayed`      | The provider delayed the message delivery (for example, due to throttling).                  |
| `dropped`      | The provider dropped the message before attempting delivery.                          |
| `unsubscribed` | The recipient unsubscribed from further messages.                                     |
| `complaint`    | The recipient marked the message as spam or filed a complaint.                        |


## Supported Providers and Events

Novu currently supports inbound webhooks for several email providers. Each provider sends events in its own format, which Novu normalizes into a consistent set of internal statuses. These normalized statuses are used in the activity feed, step-run traces, and outbound webhook forwarding.

Events not listed in the tables below are ignored.

### SendGrid

| Provider event (`<native_status>`) | Novu event (`<novu_event_status>`) |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `open`                             | `opened`                           |
| `bounce`                           | `bounced`                          |
| `click`                            | `clicked`                          |
| `dropped`                          | `dropped`                          |
| `delivered`                        | `delivered`                        |

## Viewing Event data

Once your inbound webhooks are configured, Novu will start processing events from your provider. You can see this new data in two key places within the platform.

### Activity Feed

The Activity Feed provides the most direct view of the notification lifecycle. After a notification is sent, you will see new status updates such as Delivered, Opened, and Clicked appear in the timeline as they are received from your provider. This gives you a complete, real-time picture of subscriber engagement for each notification.

### Outbound Webhooks integration

Inbound webhooks don’t just update Novu internally, they can also trigger outbound webhooks, allowing you to send normalized events to your own systems in real time. This makes it possible to extend Novu’s notification lifecycle into your existing infrastructure.

How it works

1. A provider emits an event (for example, delivered).
2. Novu receives and normalizes the event (for example, → delivered).
3. Novu updates its internal message entity and step-run trace.
4. If outbound webhooks are enabled, Novu forwards the normalized event to your configured outbound webhook endpoint.

This is useful in a number of use cases including:
- Internal logging: Forward all events into your organization’s centralized logging pipeline.
- Custom analytics: Combine Novu’s lifecycle data with your own metrics to measure engagement and delivery performance.
- Workflow triggers: Kick off custom business logic when specific events occur (for example, flagging accounts with high bounce rates).
