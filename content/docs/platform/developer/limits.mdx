Novu enforces default limits on specific resources and configurations. These limits apply to all new accounts by default.


Resource | Default limit |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Workflows** | You can create a maximum number of 100 workflows per account.|
| **Steps** | You can create a maximum number of 20 steps per workflow.|
| **Context** | You can create a maximum number of five contexts per workflow trigger.|
