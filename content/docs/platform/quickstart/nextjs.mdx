This guide walks you through integrating Novuâ€™s Inbox into your Next.js application for in-app notifications in real-time, from setup to triggering your first notification. By the end, you'll have a working notification inbox.

<Steps>
  <Step>
  ### Create a Novu account
    [Create a Novu account](https://dashboard-v2.novu.co/auth/sign-up) or [sign in](https://dashboard-v2.novu.co/auth/sign-in) to an existing account
  </Step>

  <Step>
  ### Create a Next.js application
    Create a new Next.js app using the command below. Skip this step if you already have an existing project:

    ```package-install
    npx create-next-app@latest
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step>
  ### Install Novuâ€™s inbox package
  
  To install the Inbox package, run:
  
  ```package-install
  npm install @novu/nextjs
  ```

  </Step>

  <Step>
  ### Create an Inbox component
    In the `src` directory of your Next.js project, create a `components/inbox.tsx` file with the following content:

    <InboxCodeBlock />

    If youâ€™re signed in to your Novu account, then the :tooltip[applicationIdentifier]{label="The application identifier is a unique identifier for your application. You can find it in the Novu Dashboard under the API keys page."} and :tooltip[subscriberId]{label="The subscriber ID is the unique identifier for the user in your application, typically the user's id in your database."} are automatically entered in the code sample above. However if itâ€™s not, here is how to access them:
    * `applicationIdentifier` â€“ In the Novu dashboard, click API Keys, and then locate your unique Application Identifier.
    * `subscriberId` â€“ This represents a user in your system, usually the user id from your database. For the quick start purposes we are going to use an auto-generated `subscriberId` for your Dashboard user.

    <Callout type="info">
      **Note:** If you pass a `subscriberId` that does not exist yet, Novu will automatically create a new subscriber with that ID.
    </Callout>

  </Step>

  <Step>
  ### Add the notification inbox component to your navbar
    In the `layout.tsx` file, import the `NotificationInbox` component, and add it to your navbar. By default, it will show a bell icon, which opens the Inbox UI when clicked:

    ```tsx title="app/layout.tsx"
    import { NotificationInbox } from "@/components/inbox"; // [!code highlight]

    export default function RootLayout({
      children,
    }: {
      children: React.ReactNode;
    }) {
      return (
        <html lang="en">
          <body>
            <nav>
             // [!code highlight]
              <NotificationInbox />
            </nav>
            {children}
          </body>
        </html>
      );
    }
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step>
  ### Run Your Application
    Start your development server:

    ```package-install
    npm run dev
    ```
    Once the application is running, a bell icon will appear in the navbar. Clicking it opens the notification inbox UI.

    Currently, there are no notifications. Letâ€™s trigger one!

  </Step>

  <Step>
  ### Trigger your first notification
    In this step, you'll create a simple workflow to send your first notification via the Inbox component. Follow these steps to set up and trigger a workflow from your Novu dashboard.
    1. Go to your [Novu dashboard](https://dashboard-v2.novu.co/auth/sign-in).
    2. In the sidebar, click **Workflows**.
    3. Click **Create Workflow**. Enter a name for your workflow (e.g., "Welcome Notification").
    4. Click **Create Workflow** to save it.
    5. Click the **Add Step** icon in the workflow editor and then select **In-App** as the step type.
    6. In the In-App template editor, enter the following:
        - **Subject**: "Welcome to Novu"
        - **Body**: "Hello, world! "
    7. Once youâ€™ve added the subject and body, close the editor.
    8. Click **Trigger**.
    9. Click **Test Workflow**.

  </Step>

  <Step>
  ###  View the notification in your app
    Go back to your Next.js app, then click the bell icon.

    You should see the notification you just sent from Novu! ðŸŽ‰

  </Step>
