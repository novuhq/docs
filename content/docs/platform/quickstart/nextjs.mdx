Learn how to integrate Novuâ€™s Inbox for real-time in-app notifications in your Next.js application. By the end of this guide, youâ€™ll have a working notification inbox that displays messages triggered from the Novu dashboard.

<Steps>
  <Step>
  ### Create a Novu account
    [Create a Novu account](https://dashboard.novu.co/auth/sign-up) or [sign in](https://dashboard.novu.co/auth/sign-in) to access the Novu dashboard.
  </Step>

  <Step>
  ### Install `@novu/nextjs`
  In your Next.js project, run the following command to install the Novu Inbox SDK:
  
  ```package-install
  npm install @novu/nextjs
  ```

  </Step>

  <Step>
  ### Add the notification Inbox to your app
    Import Novuâ€™s built-in <Method href="/platform/inbox/react/components/inbox">{`<Inbox />`}</Method> component into your layout file and place it in the navbar:

    <InboxCodeBlock />

    If you are signed in to your Novu account, then the :tooltip[applicationIdentifier]{label="The application identifier is a unique identifier for your application."} and :tooltip[subscriberId]{label="The subscriber ID is the unique identifier for the user in your application, typically the user's ID in your database."} will be automatically populated. Otherwise, retrieve them from:
    * `applicationIdentifier`: On the Novu dashboard, click **API Keys**, and copy your unique Application Identifier.
    * `subscriberId`: This represents a user in your system, usually the user ID from your database. For testing, you can use the auto-generated subscriberId from your Novu dashboard. You can locate it under the Subscribers tab on the Novu dashboard.

    <Callout type="info">
      **Note:** If you pass a `subscriberId` that does not exist yet, Novu will automatically create a new subscriber with that ID.
    </Callout>
    </Step>
  <Step>
  ### Run your application
    Start your development server:

    ```package-install
    npm run dev
    ```
    Once your application is running, you would see a **bell icon** in the navbar. Click on it, to open the notification Inbox UI.

    There are no notifications yet, so letâ€™s trigger one!

  </Step>

  <Step>
  ### Trigger your first notification
    In this step, you'll create a simple workflow to send your first notification via the Inbox component. Follow these steps to set up and trigger a workflow from your Novu dashboard.
    1. Go to your [Novu dashboard](https://dashboard.novu.co/auth/sign-in).
    2. Click **Workflows**.
    3. Click **Create Workflow** and then enter a name (e.g., "Welcome Notification").
    4. Click **Create Workflow** to save it.
    5. Click the **Add Step** icon in the workflow editor and then select **In-App** as the step type.
    6. In the **In-App template editor**, enter:
        - **Subject**: "Welcome to Novu"
        - **Body**: "Hello, world!"
    7. Once youâ€™ve added the subject and body, close the editor.
    8. Click **Trigger**.
    9. Click **Test Workflow**.

  </Step>

  <Step>
  ###  View the notification in your app
    Go back to your Next.js app, then click the bell icon.

    You should see the notification you just sent from Novu! ðŸŽ‰
