This guide walks you through integrating Novu's Inbox into your Vue application for real time in-app notifications, from setup to triggering your first notification. By the end, you'll have a working notification inbox.

<Callout type="info">
  This guide uses @novu/js javascript sdk to build the Inbox component in Vue. Novu currently does not support native Vue Inbox component.
</Callout>

<Steps>
  <Step>
  ### Create a Novu account
    <a href="https://dashboard.novu.co/auth/sign-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Create a Novu account</a> or <a href="https://dashboard.novu.co/auth/sign-in" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sign in</a> to access the Novu dashboard.
  </Step>

    <Step>
  ### Create a Vue application
    Run the following command to create a new Vue app:

    ```package-install
    npm create vue@latest novu-inbox-vue
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
  ### Install `@novu/js`
  The [Novu JavaScript SDK](/platform/sdks/javascript) gives you access to the Inbox component.

  Run the following command to install the SDK:

    ```package-install
    npm install @novu/js
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
  ### Add the Inbox component
  Create the `src/components/NovuInbox.vue` file to add the Inbox component passing :tooltip[applicationIdentifier]{label="The application identifier is a unique identifier for your application. You can find it in the Novu Dashboard under the API keys page."} and :tooltip[subscriberId]{label="The subscriber ID is the unique identifier for the user in your application, typically the user's id in your database."}:

  <CodeTemplateBlock templateId="vue-inbox" />

     If you're signed in to your Novu account, then the :tooltip[applicationIdentifier]{label="The application identifier is a unique identifier for your application. You can find it in the Novu Dashboard under the API keys page."} and :tooltip[subscriberId]{label="The subscriber ID is the unique identifier for the user in your application, typically the user's id in your database."} are automatically entered in the code sample above. Otherwise, you can manually retrieve them:
    * `applicationIdentifier` - In the Novu dashboard, click API Keys, and then locate your unique Application Identifier.
    * `subscriberId` - This represents a user in your system (typically the user's ID in your database). For quick start purposes, an auto-generated subscriberId is provided for your Dashboard user.

    <Callout type="info">
      **Note:** If you pass a `subscriberId` that does not exist yet, Novu will automatically create a new subscriber with that ID.
    </Callout>

  </Step>

  <Step>
  ### Add the Inbox component to your application
  Import and use the `NovuInbox` component in `src/App.vue` file:

  ```vue title="src/App.vue"
  <script setup lang="ts">
  import NovuInbox from "./components/NovuInbox.vue";
  </script>

  <template>
    <NovuInbox />
  </template>
  ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
  ### Run Your Application
  Start your development server:

  ```package-install
  npm run start
  ```
  Once the application is running, a bell icon will appear on the top left side of the screen. Clicking it opens the notification inbox UI.

  Currently, there are no notifications. Let's trigger one!

  </Step>

  <Step>
  ### Trigger your first notification

  In this step, you'll create a simple workflow to send your first notification via the Inbox component. Follow these steps to set up and trigger a workflow from your Novu dashboard.

  1. Go to your [Novu dashboard](https://dashboard-v2.novu.co/auth/sign-in).
  2. In the sidebar, click **Workflows**.
  3. Click **Create Workflow**. Enter a name for your workflow (e.g., "Welcome Notification").
  4. Click **Create Workflow** to save it.
  5. Click the **Add Step** icon in the workflow editor and then select **In-App** as the step type.
  6. In the In-App template editor, enter the following:

    - **Subject**: "Welcome to Novu"
    - **Body**: "Hello, world! "

  7. Once you've added the subject and body, close the editor.
  8. Click **Trigger**.
  9. Click **Test Workflow**.

  </Step>

  <Step>
  ###  View the notification in your app
  Go back to your Vue app, then click the bell icon.

  You should see the notification you just sent from Novu! ðŸŽ‰

  </Step>
