## Why Novu?

Novu is designed to provide a powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use notification solution that helps teams save time, reduce complexity, and improve user engagement across multiple platforms. Here’s what sets it apart from other notification infrastructure solutions:

### The only fully open-source notification infrastructure

- **Backed by a growing open-source community**. Novu is 100% open-source, with a rich community of creative minds constantly contributing to improve its capabilities.
- **Built with an API-first approach**. Developers can deeply customize workflows and automate notifications through Novu APIs.
- **Easily integrates with existing tools**. Novu works with modern development stacks, enabling smooth adoption without disrupting workflows.

### Best-in-class in-app notification inbox

- **Simplifies in-app notifications**. Developers can integrate real-time notifications in any web or mobile app with six lines of code.
- **Offers full customization**. Developers can use hooks and headless libraries to modify the look and feel of the inbox UI.
- **Empowers users with preferences**. The <Method href="/platform/inbox/react/components/inbox">{`<Inbox />`}</Method> built-in preference management lets your users control how they receive notifications.

### True omnichannel notification management

- **Unifies all notification channels**. Developers can manage email, in-app, push, SMS, and chat notifications from a single API.
- **Optimizes delivery strategies**. Novu enables multi-step workflows, ensuring users receive messages in the most effective channel.
- **Reduces notification overload**. The digest feature consolidates updates (for example, “10 new likes on your post”), improving user experience.

### Flexible workflow automation: no-code or code-first

- **No-code workflow automation**. The drag-and-drop workflow builder makes notification automation accessible to your non-technical teams via the Novu’s dashboard.
- **Provides ultimate control with code-first workflows**. [The Novu Framework SDK](/platform/sdks/overview) lets developers define workflows in code, integrate with CI/CD, and add custom automation logic.
- **Consistent notification experience across teams**. Standardizes notification patterns, preventing each team from implementing separate, inconsistent solutions.

### Advanced features for power users

- **Extends functionality with the Novu Framework SDK**. Developers can integrate custom workflows beyond Novu’s default capabilities.
- **Enhances real-time engagement**. Subscriber presence tracking detects if a user is online before sending notifications.
- **Supports multi-tenancy**. Ideal for SaaS businesses managing multiple customer accounts.

### Cost-effective with clear, transparent pricing

- **Eliminates unpredictable costs**. Fixed pricing ensures startups and enterprises can scale without hidden fees.
- **Offers a free tier for easy adoption**. Independent developers and small businesses can get started at no cost.
