## Who is Novu for?

How you use and get started with Novu depends on your role. While it’s initially implemented by engineering and development teams, Novu unifies everyone in an organization that authors, creates, sends, manages, and measures results from notifications being sent to end users. Novu empowers engineers to deliver notification platforms for product teams.

### Novu for developers and engineers

Novu empowers developers and engineering teams to quickly deliver a fully extensible notifications platform for product teams to create captivating notification experiences.

We provide the following proven stack for developers to simply integrate notifications into their products:

- **[Code-first Notification Framework](/framework/typescript/overview)** Opinionated, yet flexible, Framework for building and managing notification workflows.
- **[JSON Schema Based](/api-reference/overview)** Controls to craft a no-code visual editor to enable non-technical team members to modify content and behaviour.
- **[Prebuilt, customisable UI components](/platform/inbox/overview)** for in-app user notification feeds and preference experiences.
- **[Integration with multiple delivery providers](/platform/integrations/overview)**, allowing you to continue using your preferred vendors with Novu.
- **[Scalable, reliable Novu Cloud SaaS infrastructure](https://dashboard.novu.co)** developed from scratch to meet the demands of high-volume notification delivery and storage (think hundreds of millions of notifications).
- **Observability** for delving into the lifecycle of a notification's success or failure. Eliminate guesswork of how, when, and why a user receives a notification.
- **Comprehensive documentation**, implementation guides, recipes and illustrative examples.
- **Compliance and security** for safely managing your data.
- **Open source** provides transparency you can trust, cultivates community contributions for fast improvement, and enables you to deploy and self-host a Novu instance into any environment of your choosing.

Notification content can be written in a variety of common content tooling, including [React](/framework/content/react-email), [Vue-email](/framework/content/vue-email), MJML, and more. Content can also be customized and hydrated using any datasource.
