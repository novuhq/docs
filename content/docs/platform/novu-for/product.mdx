Novu Framework was designed to bridge the gap between developers and non-developers in the team.

- **Developers** - Define and abstract away complex logic, data manipulation, hydration, html, and etc...
- **Non-Developers** - Use the Novu Dashboard UI to control the content and behavior of the notifications using [controls](/framework/controls).

## How to modify controls?

Controls are modified directly in the [Novu Dashboard UI](https://dashboard.novu.co), under the 'Step controls' tab of the **Workflow Editor** page.
Upon saving the changes, the new Control values will be used in the notification sent to your subscribers.

## Dynamic payload data

Dynamic data passed as part of the trigger payload can be easily used inside of the Controls. For example, you can pass a `user_name` as part of the payload and use it in the controls as `{{payload.user_name}}` to personalize the notification.

## Common usecases

### Change notification content

A control can be as broad as `content` or as specific as `2fa_code_title_color`. This allows you to change the content of the notification without needing to touch the code.

### Create new email designs

Novu's built-in email editor enables rich content creation without ever touching the code.

### Change digest or delay frequency

Controls can be used for controlling any aspect of the step configuration, for example:

- Delay amount
- Digest length
- Digest type (daily, weekly, monthly)
- etc...

### Control structure and layout

Controls can be used to show/hide or rearrange the layout of the notification.
For example, you can have an input to show/hide a button, or change the position of a specific email section.
