It is the only provider for the in-app channel and it _can be used in production apps_. Unlike sms and email, it is not active by default and needs to be turned on separately. It can be scaled as per your need and it is a 'pay as you go' offering. You can check [this](https://novu.co/pricing/?utm_campaign=docs-default-providers) for more details.

## Limits of the Novu Providers

Following are the limits for our email and sms providers:

1. Email: 300 emails per organization per month
2. SMS: 20 messages per organization per month

To send more than these limits, you can configure a different provider for a specific channel.
