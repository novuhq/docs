## Novu Email Provider

Novu offers a demo email provider that you can use to send emails to yourself during the evaluation period. This provider should not be used in production or staging environments.

### Limits of the Novu Demo Providers

300 emails per organization per month, and those can be only sent to the current logged in user.
To send more than these limits, or to other email addresses, you can configure your own email provider from the Integration store.
