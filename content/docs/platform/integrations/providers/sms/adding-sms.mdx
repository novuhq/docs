## Sending SMS overrides

The overrides field supports a `sms` property and `from`, `to`, `content` field overrides. This allows you to send a message to a different recipient, from a different sender, or with a different content.

```javascript
import { Novu } from '@novu/node';

const novu = new Novu('<NOVU_SECRET_KEY>');

novu.trigger('<WORKFLOW_TRIGGER_IDENTIFIER>', {
  to: {
    subscriberId: '<SUBSCRIBER_ID>',
  }
  overrides: {
    sms: {
      to: '+123012345678',
      from: 'Novu Team',
      content: 'This SMS message is from overrides'
    },
  },
});
```

## Using different SMS integration

In Novu integration store, multiple SMS channel type provider integrations can be active at the same time. But only one provider integration can be primary at a time. This primary integration will be used as a provider to deliver the SMS by default. If you want to use a different active provider integration then you can use the `integrationIdentifier` sms overrides field.

If there are 4 active SMS integrations with these identifiers:-

1. twilio-abcdef
2. twilio-ghijkl
3. firetext-abcdef
4. infobip-abcdef

Here, if `twilio-abcdef` is primary integration and you want to use `infobip-abcdef` with this trigger then you can use `integrationIdentifier` sms overrides field as below:-

<Tabs items={['Node.js']}>
<Tab value="Node.js">
```javascript
import { Novu } from '@novu/node';

const novu = new Novu('<NOVU_SECRET_KEY>');

novu.trigger('<WORKFLOW_TRIGGER_IDENTIFIER>', {
to: {
subscriberId: '<SUBSCRIBER_ID>',
},
overrides: {
sms: {
integrationIdentifier: 'infobip-abcdef',
},
},
});

```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="info">
Integration identifier is similar to Provider identifier but it is different than Provider Id. It is unique for each integration. You can find the `integrationIdentifier` in the integration store page.
</Callout>
