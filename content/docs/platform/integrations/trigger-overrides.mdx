description: 'Learn how to customize provider behavior using Trigger Overrides in Novu'
---

Trigger overrides allow you to modify the default behavior of specific aspects of a notification trigger, giving you granular control over how messages are delivered across different channels and providers.

## Provider overrides

Provider overrides give you fine-grained control over how messages are delivered by allowing direct configuration of the underlying provider SDKs during the workflow's trigger phase.

This feature is designed for advanced use cases where Novu's default message editor or UI does not expose specific provider capabilities.

Use provider overrides to:
- Access native provider features not surfaced by Novu’s abstraction layer. For example, custom headers in SendGrid, topic messaging in FCM, or Slack blocks.
- Adapt to provider-specific options by injecting parameters that Novu doesn’t yet officially support.
- Configure shared or unique settings across steps without altering templates or workflow logic.

This mechanism acts as a flexible escape hatch, allowing you to pass deeply nested payloads that align directly with your provider’s native API. It helps decouple workflow behavior from provider-specific implementation details, essential when working across multiple channels like email, push, or chat.

<Callout type="info">Because overrides interact directly with provider SDKs, it won’t work if it’s misconfigured. Make sure you understand the supported options for each provider before using this feature. </Callout>

### Override structure

Overrides are defined in the `overrides` property of a trigger payload. You can specify configuration values at two levels:
Step-level: Targets a specific step in the workflow.
- Provider-level: Applies to all steps using a specific provider.
- Each level serves different use cases and follows a clear order of precedence.

#### Step-level overrides

Step-level overrides apply configuration to a specific workflow step. This is the most granular level of control and always takes precedence over provider-level settings and values defined in the workflow editor.
Use step-level overrides when:

- You want different configurations for steps using the same provider.
- You need to adjust message content or metadata for a single step only.

```typescript
import { Novu } from "@novu/api";

const novu = new Novu({ secretKey: "<YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE>" });

async function run() {
  const result = await novu.trigger({
    to: {
      subscriberId: "subscriber_unique_identifier",
      firstName: "Albert",
      lastName: "Einstein",
      email: "albert@einstein.com",
      phone: "+1234567890",
    },
    workflowId: "workflow_identifier",
    payload: {
      comment_id: "string",
      post: {
        text: "string",
      },
    },
    overrides: {
      steps: {
        'push-step': {
          providers: {
            fcm: {
              notification: {
                title: 'New Comment',
                body: 'Someone replied to your post!',
                sound: 'default', // Play default system sound
              },
              android: {
                notification: {
                  sound: 'sound_bell' // matches res/raw/sound_bell.mp3
                }
              },
              apns: {
                payload: {
                  aps: {
                    sound: 'notification_bell.caf' // For iOS
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  });
}

run();

```
In this example, only the `push-step` is affected, and only the FCM `title` is overridden for that step.

#### Provider-level overrides

Provider-level overrides apply configuration to all steps that use a given provider in the workflow. They’re useful for applying shared logic across multiple steps, without repeating the same settings in each one.

Use provider-level overrides when:
- You need to define common metadata like headers, personalization, or layout settings.
- You want consistent behavior across all steps for a given provider.

If both step-level and provider-level overrides define the same field, then the step-level value takes precedence.

```typescript
import { Novu } from "@novu/api";

const novu = new Novu("<YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE>");

async function run() {
  const result = await novu.trigger({
    to: {
      subscriberId: "subscriber_unique_identifier",
      firstName: "Albert",
      lastName: "Einstein",
      email: "albert@einstein.com",
      phone: "+1234567890",
    },
    workflowId: "workflow_identifier",
    payload: {
      comment_id: "string",
      post: {
        text: "string",
      },
    },
    overrides: {
      providers: {
        sendgrid: {
          template_id: "xxxxxxxx", // Make sure this is a string
          trackingSettings: {
            clickTracking: {
              enable: true,
              enableText: false,
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  });
}

run();

```

This configuration affects every step in the workflow that uses SendGrid, unless a step-level override provides a more specific value.
