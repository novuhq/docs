Push providers are the services that deliver notifications your subscribers' devices, which can be delivered through mobile, desktop, or web. Each provider must be set up individually in the Novu dashboard.

Novu provides a unified integration layer that connects your workflows to these providers. Once you’ve configured your push integrations, Novu automatically handles message delivery, routing each notification through the correct provider without requiring extra setup. 

This lets you manage multiple integrations even for the same provider, all from one place, giving you full flexibility and centralized control over your push notifications.

## Key features

- **Multi-Provider Support**: Integrate with providers like Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), OneSignal, or Apple Push Notification Service (APNS)
- **Unified Delivery**: Streamline your push notifications with a single API for mobile and web platforms
- **Device Management**: Keep subscriber device tokens in sync using just-in-time or manual updates

## How Push works in Novu

Here is the step-by-step process for sending a push notification with Novu:

<Steps>
<Step>
### Add a push provider

Start by adding a push channel provider in the **Integration Store** on your Novu dashboard.
You can connect one or more integrations for the same provider, each with its own credentials and environment configuration.
</Step>

<Step>
### Add the Push channel to your workflow

Next, include a Push step in an existing or new workflow. This step defines when and how a push message should be sent as part of your notification logic.

</Step>
<Step>
### Store device tokens for your subscribers

Each subscriber in Novu must have a valid device token or identifier specific to the connected provider.
These tokens are stored in the subscriber’s profile and can be added or updated using the SDK or API.
Novu uses these tokens to route messages to the correct device when a workflow runs.

</Step>
<Step>
### Trigger the workflow

Finally, trigger the workflow by sending an event from your application code.
Novu automatically resolves the subscriber, selects the right integration, and delivers the message through the configured push provider.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Managing push device tokens

To send push notifications, each subscriber must have one or more device tokens or identifiers associated with their profile.

These tokens are unique identifiers that help push notification providers deliver messages to the correct devices. Each provider has its own method for obtaining device tokens, refer to your provider's guide to learn how to obtain the device tokens.

<Callout type="info"> The code examples in this section use fcm. For other providers, replace `ChatOrPushProviderEnum.Fcm` with the correct enum for your provider, such as `ChatOrPushProviderEnum.Apns` or `ChatOrPushProviderEnum.Expo`. </Callout>

### Add push device tokens

Novu offers two ways of adding device tokens to a subscriber's profile, either updating them just in time or manually.

#### Add device tokens during just-in-time

You can pass the device tokens in the `channels` array of the subscriber object when triggering a workflow. Novu automatically updates the subscriber's profile with these tokens before sending the message. Here is an example with FCM:

```typescript
import { Novu } from '@novu/api';
import { ChatOrPushProviderEnum } from "@novu/api/models/components";

const novu = new Novu({
  secretKey: "<NOVU_SECRET_KEY>",
  // Use serverURL for EU region
  // serverURL: "https://eu.api.novu.co",
});

await novu.trigger({
  workflowId: "workflowId",
  to: {
    subscriberId: "subscriberId",
    channels: [
      {
        providerId: ChatOrPushProviderEnum.Fcm,
        credentials: {
          deviceTokens: ["token-1", "token-2"],
        }
      },
    ],
  },
  payload: {},
});
```

#### Add device tokens manually

You can manually store or update device tokens for a subscriber using the [Update provider credentials API](/api-reference/subscribers/update-provider-credentials).

This method is useful when you manage device registration outside of your workflow triggers (for example, after a user logs in).

      ]
    }
  }'
  ```
  </Tab>

### Add device tokens for multiple integrations

Novu supports multiple active integrations per provider for the push channel. For example, you can have more than one active FCM integration at a time (for example, one for your customer app and one for your internal app).

By default, device tokens are stored for the most recently created integration. To store device tokens for a specific integration, you must use the `integrationIdentifier` field. This is the identifier for the integration, which you can find in the Novu dashboard.

      ]
    },
    "integrationIdentifier": "fcm-MnGLxp8uy"
  }'
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Removing device tokens

To remove device token(s) from subscriber credentials, follow this process:

When a subscriber logs out of a device, you should remove that device token from the subscriber's credentials in other to prevent another subscriber who may log in to the same device from receiving notifications meant for the previous subscriber.

<Callout>It is recommended to handle token removal server-side, such as during a user logout event, to prevent stale or invalid tokens from causing failed deliveries.</Callout>

#### Remove a specific token

To remove device tokens from subscriber credentials, follow this process:
- Fetch the subscriber's current token list.
- Filter out the token you want to remove.
- Update the subscriber with the new, filtered list.

```ts
import { Novu } from '@novu/api';
import { ChatOrPushProviderEnum } from "@novu/api/models/components";

const novu = new Novu({
  secretKey: "<NOVU_SECRET_KEY>",
});

const subscriberId = "subscriberId";
const providerId = ChatOrPushProviderEnum.Fcm;

// 1. Fetch current credentials
const { data: subscriber } = await novu.subscribers.get(subscriberId);
const currentTokens = subscriber.credentials[providerId]?.deviceTokens || [];

// 2. Remove the specific token
const filteredTokens = currentTokens.filter(token => token !== "token_to_remove");

// 3. Update subscriber
await novu.subscribers.credentials.update(
  {
    providerId,
    credentials: {
      deviceTokens: filteredTokens,
    },
  },
  subscriberId
);
```

#### Remove all tokens

To remove all device tokens for a provider, or for a specific integration, update the credentials with an empty array.

```tsx
import { Novu } from '@novu/api';
import { ChatOrPushProviderEnum } from "@novu/api/models/components";

const novu = new Novu({
  secretKey: "<NOVU_SECRET_KEY>",
});

await novu.subscribers.credentials.update(
  {
    providerId: ChatOrPushProviderEnum.Fcm,
    credentials: {
      deviceTokens: [],
    },
  },
  "subscriberId"
);
```
