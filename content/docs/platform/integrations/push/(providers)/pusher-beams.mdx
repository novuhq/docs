<a href="https://pusher.com/beams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pusher Beams</a> is a cross-platform push notification API service provided by Pusher.

This guide will walk you through the entire process of configuring and using <a href="https://pusher.com/beams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pusher Beams</a> with Novu, from getting your credentials to sending your first notification.

## How to configure Pusher Beams with Novu

Before you can send notifications, you must get your credentials from a Pusher Beams Instance and add them to your Novu integration settings.

### Step 1: Get your Pusher Beams credentials

To enable Pusher Beams integration, you need to create a Pusher Beams Instance and use both `Instance ID` and `Secret Key` from the Instance [dashboard](https://dashboard.pusher.com/beams/).

1. Log in to the Pusher Beams dashboard
2. Click **Create instance**
3. Enter the instance name and then click **Create**

4. In the instance dashboard, click **Keys** from the sidebar and copy the **Instance ID** and **Primary key** you will need them in [Step 2](/platform/integrations/push/pusher-beams#step-2-connect-pusher-beams-to-novu).

### Step 2: Connect Pusher Beams to Novu

Next, add these credentials to your Pusher Beams integration in the Novu dashboard.

1.  Log in to the Novu dashboard.
2.  Navigate to the **Integration Store** page on the Novu dashboard.
3.  Click **Connect Provider**.
4.  Under the **Push** tab, select **Pusher Beams**.
5.  In the Pusher Beams integration form, paste your **Instance ID** and **Secret Key** into the corresponding fields.

6.  Click **Create Integration**.

## Using Pusher Beams with Novu

Once your integration is configured, you can start sending push notifications by registering your subscribers' `userId` and triggering a workflow.

### Step 1: Add subscriber device token

After <a href="https://pusher.com/docs/beams/reference/all-libraries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">setting up the Pusher Beams SDK</a> in your application, you must associate users with their devices using Pusher Beams' <a href="https://pusher.com/docs/beams/guides/publish-to-specific-user/web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Authenticated Users</a> feature. This assigns them a `userId`.

To target a Pusher Beams user from Novu, you must register this `userId` as the `deviceToken` for their Novu subscriber profile. You can retrieve this value using the <a href="https://pusher.com/docs/beams/reference/web/#getuserid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`getUserId()`</a> method from the Pusher Beams SDK.

You can do this by making an API call to [update the subscriber's credentials](/api-reference/subscribers/update-provider-credentials).

```typescript
import { Novu } from '@novu/api';
import { ChatOrPushProviderEnum } from "@novu/api/models/components";

const novu = new Novu({
  secretKey: "<NOVU_SECRET_KEY>",
  // Use serverURL for EU region
  // serverURL: "https://eu.api.novu.co",
});

await novu.subscribers.credentials.update(
  {
    providerId: ChatOrPushProviderEnum.PusherBeams,
    // Use integrationIdentifier to store device tokens for a specific integration
    integrationIdentifier: "pusher-beams-MnGLxp8uy",
    credentials: {
      deviceTokens: ["token1", "token2", "token3"],
    },
  },
  "subscriberId"
);
```
</Tab>

```bash
curl -L -X PUT 'https://api.novu.co/v1/subscribers/<SUBSCRIBER_ID>/credentials' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: ApiKey <NOVU_SECRET_KEY>' \
-d '{
  "providerId": "pusher-beams",
  "deviceTokens": ['userId-from-pusher-beams'],
  "integrationIdentifier": "pusher-beams-MnGLxp8uy"
}'
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Step 2: Send a notification

Now you're ready to send a push notification. Create a workflow with a Push step in the editor and trigger it. Novu will send the notification to the `userId`'s associated with the subscriber.

The example below demonstrates a simple trigger using Novu’s SDK.

```typescript
import { Novu } from '@novu/api';

const novu = new Novu({
  secretKey: "<NOVU_SECRET_KEY>",
  // Use serverURL for EU region
  // serverURL: "https://eu.api.novu.co",
});

await novu.trigger({
  workflowId: "workflowId",
  to: {
    subscriberId: "subscriberId",
  },
  payload: {
    custom_data: 'custom_data', // the payload will be sent as notification data object. Cannot contain the key "pusher"
  },
});
```
