[Pusher Beams](https://pusher.com/beams/) is a cross-platform push notification API service provided by Pusher.

To enable Pusher Beams integration, you need to create a Pusher Beams Instance and use both `Instance ID` and `Secret Key` from the Instance [dashboard](https://dashboard.pusher.com/beams/).

## Setting the Device Token

Once Pusher Beams instance has been created, and the Pusher Beams SDK has been [set up and configured](https://pusher.com/docs/beams/reference/all-libraries/) for your application, you can associate users with their devices using [Authenticated Users](https://pusher.com/docs/beams/guides/publish-to-specific-user/web/).

This identifier allows targeting your user when sending push notifications without having to retrieve the specific Web, Android or iOS device tokens - which are managed by Pusher Beams.

In order to target the Pusher Beams user from Novu, you must register the Pusher Beams Authenticated Users with their `userId` as the `deviceToken` for your Novu subscriber. This value can be retrieved via [getUserId()](https://pusher.com/docs/beams/reference/web/#getuserid) method from the SDK for your platform.

Once you have the user's `userId` value, the `deviceToken` for your Novu subscriber can be set via:

    // Use integrationIdentifier to store device tokens for a specific integration
    integrationIdentifier: "pusher-beams-MnGLxp8uy",
    credentials: {
      deviceTokens: ["token1", "token2", "token3"],
    },
  },

);

## SDK Trigger Example

```typescript
import { Novu } from '@novu/api';

const novu = new Novu({
  secretKey: "<NOVU_SECRET_KEY>",
  // Use serverURL for EU region
  // serverURL: "https://eu.api.novu.co",
});

await novu.trigger({
  workflowId: "workflowId",
  to: {
    subscriberId: "subscriberId",
  },
  payload: {
    custom_data: 'custom_data', // the payload will be sent as notification data object. Cannot contain the key "pusher"
  },
});
```
