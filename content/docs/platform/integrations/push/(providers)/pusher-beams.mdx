[Pusher Beams](https://pusher.com/beams/) is a cross-platform push notification API service provided by Pusher.

To enable Pusher Beams integration, you need to create a Pusher Beams Instance and use both `Instance ID` and `Secret Key` from the Instance [dashboard](https://dashboard.pusher.com/beams/).

## Setting the Device Token

Once Pusher Beams instance has been created, and the Pusher Beams SDK has been [set up and configured](https://pusher.com/docs/beams/reference/all-libraries/) for your application, you can associate users with their devices using [Authenticated Users](https://pusher.com/docs/beams/guides/publish-to-specific-user/web/).

This identifier allows targeting your user when sending push notifications without having to retrieve the specific Web, Android or iOS device tokens - which are managed by Pusher Beams.

In order to target the Pusher Beams user from Novu, you must register the Pusher Beams Authenticated Users with their `userId` as the `deviceToken` for your Novu subscriber. This value can be retrieved via [getUserId()](https://pusher.com/docs/beams/reference/web/#getuserid) method from the SDK for your platform.

Once you have the user's `userId` value, the `deviceToken` for your Novu subscriber can be set via:

<Tab value="Node.js">
```javascript
import {
  Novu,
  ChatProviderIdEnum
} from '@novu/node';

const novu = new Novu("<NOVU_SECRET_KEY>");

await novu.subscribers.setCredentials('subscriberId', PushProviderIdEnum.PusherBeams, {
  // Your user's unique 'userId' from Pusher Beams
  deviceTokens: ['userId-from-pusher-beams'],
});

````
</Tab>
<Tab value="cURL">
```bash
curl -L -X PUT 'https://api.novu.co/v1/subscribers/<SUBSCRIBER_ID>/credentials' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: ApiKey <NOVU_SECRET_KEY>' \
-d '{
  "providerId": "pusher-beams",
  "deviceTokens": ['userId-from-pusher-beams'],
  "integrationIdentifier": "pusher-beams-MnGLxp8uy"
}'
````

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## SDK Trigger Example

```typescript
import { Novu } from '@novu/node';

const novu = new Novu('<NOVU_SECRET_KEY>');

novu.trigger('<WORKFLOW_TRIGGER_IDENTIFIER>', {
  to: {
    subscriberId: '<SUBSCRIBER_ID>',
  },
  payload: {
    custom_data: 'custom_data', // the payload will be sent as notification data object. Cannot contain the key "pusher"
  },
});
```
