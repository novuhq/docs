This guide walks you through the entire process of configuring and using <a href="https://onesignal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OneSignal</a> with Novu, from getting your credentials to sending your first notification.

OneSignal supports sending messages via both <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple Push Notification Service</a> (APNs) and <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firebase Cloud Messaging</a> (FCM).

## Configure Onesignal with Novu

Before you can send push notifications via OneSignal from Novu, you need to connect your OneSignal credentials.

### Step 1: Get your OneSignal credentials

To configure the OneSignal integration, you need an active account that has credentials for APNS, FCM, or both, and have access to two values from OneSignal app's settings:

* App ID
* App API Key

Follow <a href="https://developer.apple.com/help/account/keys/create-a-private-key" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this OneSignal guide</a> to see how to access your OneSignal `App ID` and `App API key`.

### Step 2: Connect Onesignal to Novu

Next, add these keys to your OneSignal integration in the Novu dashboard.

1. Log in to the Novu dashboard.
2. On the Novu dashboard, navigate to the **Integration Store**.
3. Click **Connect provider**.
4. Click the **Push** tab.
5. Select **OneSignal**.
6. In the OneSignal integration form, paste your **App ID** and **App API Key** into the corresponding fields.

7. Click **Create Integration**.

## Using Onesignal with Novu

Once your integration is configured, you can start sending push notifications by registering your subscribers' `player_id` tokens and triggering a workflow.

### Step 1: Add subscriber device token

When you <a href="https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/onboarding-with-onesignal#step-1-setup-onesignal-sdk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">set up the OneSignal SDK</a> in your application, your users are automatically assigned a unique OneSignal <a href="https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/users#player-id" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`player_id`</a>. This ID is used to target the user for push notifications.

To target a OneSignal user from Novu, you must register their `player_id` as the `deviceToken` for their Novu subscriber profile.

You can do this by making an API call to [update the subscriber's credentials](/api-reference/subscribers/update-provider-credentials).

```typescript
import { Novu } from '@novu/api';
import { ChatOrPushProviderEnum } from "@novu/api/models/components";

const novu = new Novu({
  secretKey: "<NOVU_SECRET_KEY>",
  // Use serverURL for EU region
  // serverURL: "https://eu.api.novu.co",
});

await novu.subscribers.credentials.update(
  {
    providerId: ChatOrPushProviderEnum.OneSignal,
    // Use integrationIdentifier to store device tokens for a specific integration
    integrationIdentifier: "string",
    credentials: {
      deviceTokens: [
        "token1",
        "token2",
        "token3"
      ],
    },
  },
  "subscriberId"
);
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="cURL">
```bash
curl -L -X PUT 'https://api.novu.co/v1/subscribers/<SUBSCRIBER_ID>/credentials' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: ApiKey <NOVU_SECRET_KEY>' \
-d '{
  "providerId": "one-signal",
  "deviceTokens": ["token1", "token2", "token3"],
  "integrationIdentifier": "string"
}'
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>


### Step 2: Send a notification

Now you're ready to send a push notification. [Create a workflow with a Push step](/platform/workflow/build-a-workflow) and trigger it. Novu sends the notification to all devices (player IDs) associated with the subscriber.

The example below demonstrates, how to [trigger a workflow](/platform/sdks/server/typescript) using Novu’s SDK.

```typescript
import { Novu } from '@novu/node';

const novu = new Novu('YOUR_NOVU_API_KEY');

await novu.trigger('your-workflow-id', {
  to: {
    subscriberId: 'SUBSCRIBER_ID',
  },
  workflowId: "workflow_identifier",
  payload: {
    // Your payload data
  },
});
```

## Using overrides to customize notifications

Novu provides an `overrides` field that lets you send additional OneSignal-specific message fields. You can use this to control how messages are displayed or to attach custom payloads.

The overrides field supports all OneSignal Create Notification parameters. Here is an example:

```typescript
import { Novu } from '@novu/api';

const novu = new Novu({
  secretKey: "<NOVU_SECRET_KEY>",
  // Use serverURL for EU region
  // serverURL: "https://eu.api.novu.co",
});

await novu.trigger({
  workflowId: "workflowId",
  to: {
    subscriberId: "subscriberId",
  },
  payload: {
    abc: 'def', // If the notification is a data notification, the payload will be sent as the data
  },
  overrides: {
    subtitle: 'This is subtitle value',
    mutableContent: 'Mutable content value',
    // for android notification categories
    channelId: 'category_id',
    // for ios notification categories
    categoryId: 'Category id',
    // same value is used for all sizes and browsers
    icon: 'https://image.com/icon.png',
    // used for both android and ios
    sound: 'sound file url',
  },
});
```

## Using external user ID

By default, Novu uses `player_id` to send notifications, but you can select the `External ID` option in the OneSignal integration settings in Novu. If `External ID` option is selected, then `deviceTokens` stored in subscriber credentials for the OneSignal provider, are used as external user IDs.

By default, Novu uses player IDs to send notifications. If your OneSignal integration uses external user IDs, then you can switch this behavior in the OneSignal integration settings in Novu.

![Select external id option](/images/channels-and-providers/push/onesignal/select-external-id-option.gif)

Once enabled, the `deviceTokens` stored in subscriber credentials are treated as external user IDs instead of player IDs.
