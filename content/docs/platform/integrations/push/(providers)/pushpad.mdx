This guide walks you through the entire process of configuring and using <a href="https://pushpad.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pushpad</a> with Novu, from getting your credentials to sending your first notification.

<a href="https://pushpad.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pushpad</a> is a web push service that supports sending notifications to all major browsers via FCM, Mozilla autopush, Windows Push Notification Services, and APNS, with just one simple API.

## Configure Pushpad with Novu

Before you can send notifications, you need to connect your Pushpad project to Novu by getting your credentials and adding them to your integration settings.

### Step 1: Get your Pushpad credentials

To configure the Pushpad integration, you need:
- An active Pushpad account
- A Pushpad auth token (found in the [account settings](https://pushpad.xyz/access_tokens))
- Your Pushpad project ID (found in the project settings)

1. Log in to your Pushpad dashboard.
2. Click **New project** to create a project.

3. Click **Settings** on the project page and record the **Project ID**. You need it to connect to Novu.

4. Navigate to the [access token](https://pushpad.xyz/access_tokens) page
5. Click **Add access token** and then fill in the required fields to create a new access token Or using your existing token if you already have one.

6. Copy the generated token. You need it to connect to Novu.

### Step 2: Connect Pushpad to Novu

Next, add these credentials to your Pushpad integration in the Novu dashboard.

1. Log in to the Novu dashboard.
2. On the Novu dashboard, navigate to the **Integration Store**.
3. Click **Connect provider**.
4. Click the **Push** tab.
5. Select **Pushpad**.
6. In the Pushpad integration form, paste your access token and project ID from [Step 1](/platform/integrations/push/pushpad#step-1-get-your-pushpad-credentials) into the corresponding fields.

7. Click **Create Integration**.

## Using Pushpad with Novu

Once your integration is configured, you can start sending push notifications by registering your subscribers' `uid` and triggering a workflow.

### Step 1: Add subscriber device token

After [setting up the Pushpad SDK](https://pushpad.xyz/docs/pushpad_pro_getting_started) on your website, you must [assign a user ID (uid)](https://pushpad.xyz/docs/identifying_users) to your users' push subscriptions.

This `uid` is the identifier Novu uses to target a specific browser. For example, if you use `pushpad('uid', 'user123')`, then `user123` is the ID you must register in Novu.

You can do this by making an API call to [update the subscriber's credentials](/api-reference/subscribers/update-provider-credentials).

```typescript
import { Novu } from '@novu/api';
import { ChatOrPushProviderEnum } from "@novu/api/models/components";

const novu = new Novu({
  secretKey: "<NOVU_SECRET_KEY>",
  // Use serverURL for EU region
  // serverURL: "https://eu.api.novu.co",
});

await novu.subscribers.credentials.update(
  {
    providerId: ChatOrPushProviderEnum.PushPad,
    // Use integrationIdentifier to store device tokens for a specific integration
    integrationIdentifier: "pushpad-MnGLxp8uy",
    credentials: {
      deviceTokens: ["token1", "token2", "token3"],
    },
  },
  "subscriberId"
);
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="cURL">
```bash
curl -L -X PUT 'https://api.novu.co/v1/subscribers/<SUBSCRIBER_ID>/credentials' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: ApiKey <NOVU_SECRET_KEY>' \
-d '{
  "providerId": "pushpad",
  "deviceTokens": ['user123'],
  "integrationIdentifier": "pushpad-MnGLxp8uy"
}'
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Step 2: Send a notification

Now you're ready to send a push notification. [Create a workflow with a Push step](/platform/workflow/build-a-workflow) and trigger it. Novu then sends the notification to the `uid`s associated with the subscriber.

The example below demonstrates a simple trigger using Novu’s SDK.

```typescript
import { Novu } from '@novu/api';

const novu = new Novu({
  secretKey: "<NOVU_SECRET_KEY>",
  // Use serverURL for EU region
  // serverURL: "https://eu.api.novu.co",
});

await novu.trigger({
  workflowId: "workflowId",
  to: {
    subscriberId: "subscriberId",
  },
  payload: {},
});
```
