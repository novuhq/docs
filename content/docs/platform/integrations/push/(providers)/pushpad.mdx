This guide will walk you through the entire process of configuring and using <a href="https://pushpad.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pushpad</a> with Novu, from getting your credentials to sending your first notification.

<a href="https://pushpad.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pushpad</a> is a web push service that supports sending notifications to all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.) via FCM, Mozilla autopush, Windows Push Notification Services and Apple Push Notification service, with just one simple API.

## How to configure Pushpad with Novu

Before you can send notifications, you need to connect your Pushpad project to Novu by getting your credentials and adding them to your integration settings.

### Step 1: Get your Pushpad credentials

To configure the Pushpad integration, you will need an active account and you need to have a Pushpad auth token (from the [account settings](https://pushpad.xyz/access_tokens)) and your Pushpad project ID (from the project settings).

1. Log in to your Pushpad dashboard.
2. Click **New project** and create a project

3. Click **Settings** on the project page and copy the **Project ID**, you will need it to connect to Novu.

4. Navigate to the [access token](https://pushpad.xyz/access_tokens) page
5. Click **Add access token** and then fill in the required fields to create a new access token Or using your existing token if you already have one.

6. Copy the generated token, you will need it to connect to Novu

### Step 2: Connect Pushpad to Novu

Next, add these credentials to your Pushpad integration in the Novu dashboard.

1. Log in to the Novu dashboard.
2. On the Novu dashboard, navigate to the **Integration Store**.
3. Click **Connect provider**.
4. In the **Push** tab, select **Pushpad**.
5. In the Pushpad integration form, paste your access token and project ID from [Step 1](/platform/integrations/push/pushpad#step-1-get-your-pushpad-credentials) into the corresponding fields.

6. Click **Create Integration**.

## Using Pushpad with Novu

Once your integration is configured, you can start sending push notifications by registering your subscribers' `uid` and triggering a workflow.

### Step 1: Add subscriber device token

After [setting up the Pushpad SDK](https://pushpad.xyz/docs/pushpad_pro_getting_started) on your website, you must [assign a user ID (uid)](https://pushpad.xyz/docs/identifying_users) to your users' push subscriptions.

This `uid` is the identifier Novu uses to target a specific browser. For example, if you use `pushpad('uid', 'user123')`, then `user123` is the ID you must register in Novu.

You can do this by making an API call to [update the subscriber's credentials](/api-reference/subscribers/update-provider-credentials)

```typescript
import { Novu } from '@novu/api';
import { ChatOrPushProviderEnum } from "@novu/api/models/components";

const novu = new Novu({
  secretKey: "<NOVU_SECRET_KEY>",
  // Use serverURL for EU region
  // serverURL: "https://eu.api.novu.co",
});

await novu.subscribers.credentials.update(
  {
    providerId: ChatOrPushProviderEnum.PushPad,
    // Use integrationIdentifier to store device tokens for a specific integration
    integrationIdentifier: "pushpad-MnGLxp8uy",
    credentials: {
      deviceTokens: ["token1", "token2", "token3"],
    },
  },
  "subscriberId"
);
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="cURL">
```bash
curl -L -X PUT 'https://api.novu.co/v1/subscribers/<SUBSCRIBER_ID>/credentials' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: ApiKey <NOVU_SECRET_KEY>' \
-d '{
  "providerId": "pushpad",
  "deviceTokens": ['user123'],
  "integrationIdentifier": "pushpad-MnGLxp8uy"
}'
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Step 2: Send a notification

Now you're ready to send a push notification. [Create a workflow with a Push step](/platform/workflow/build-a-workflow) and trigger it. Novu will send the notification to the `uid`'s associated with the subscriber.

The example below demonstrates a simple trigger using Novuâ€™s SDK.

```typescript
import { Novu } from '@novu/api';

const novu = new Novu({
  secretKey: "<NOVU_SECRET_KEY>",
  // Use serverURL for EU region
  // serverURL: "https://eu.api.novu.co",
});

await novu.trigger({
  workflowId: "workflowId",
  to: {
    subscriberId: "subscriberId",
  },
  payload: {},
});
```
