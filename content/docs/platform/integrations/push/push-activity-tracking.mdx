---

Push notification providers typically do not offer native webhook support that can be used for activity tracking. To enable activity tracking for Push channels notifications, Novu supports a manual integration approach for push notifications. 

Where your application captures and forwards push notification events to the Novu. Once received, Novu processes and displays these events alongside other channels for a unified tracking experience.

## How it works

The process involves a four-step data flow from your subscriber's device to Novu's servers:

1.  **Client application listens**: Your application listens for push notification interactions. For example, the user opens a notification.
2.  **Event sent to your backend:** When an event occurs, your app sends a payload containing the event details to an endpoint on your own server.
3.  **Backend forwards to Novu:** Your server receives this data and uses the Novu SDK to securely forward the event to Novu's API.
4.  **Event appears in Novu:** Novu processes the event and displays it in the **Activity Feed**, alongside events from your other channels.

## Step 1: Enable push activity tracking in Novu

First, you need to enable the feature in your Novu dashboard and retrieve the necessary credentials.

1. Log in to the Novu dashboard.
2. Navigate to the **Integration Store** page and then select your push provider.
3. Enable the **Push Activity Tracking** toggle.

4. Once enabled, your unique **Environment ID** and **Integration ID** are displayed. Copy both of these; you will need them for your backend code.
5. Click **Save Changes**.

## Step 2: Listen for push events in your app

Next, when push notifications are delivered or interacted with, your app needs to capture those events and forward them to your backend. The exact code implementation depends on the push provider that you use.

The goal is to capture the event and send a JSON payload to your backend. The two most important fields to send are:
- `eventType`: A string describing the event (for example, `opened`, `clicked`).
- `eventId`: The unique identifier for the notification, which Novu includes in the push payload as `__nvMessageId`.

  });

## Step 3: Forward events to Novu from your backend

Finally, create an endpoint on your backend that receives the event data from your application and uses the Novu SDK to forward it to Novu.

```typescript
import { Novu } from '@novu/api';

const novuClient = new Novu({
  apiKey: process.env.NOVU_API_KEY,
});

// Your backend API endpoint that receives events from your mobile app
app.post('/api/notifications/events', async (req, res) => {
  // Forward the event data to Novu
  const response = await novuClient.activity.track({
    environmentId: process.env.NOVU_ENVIRONMENT_ID,
    integrationId: process.env.NOVU_INTEGRATION_ID,
    requestBody: req.body,
  });

  res.status(200).json({ success: true, data: response });
});
```
<Callout>Both `Integration ID` and `Environment ID` can be found in the Integration Store under your push provider instance (after enabling Push Activity Tracking).</Callout>

Once these steps are completed, your application will send push notification engagement data to Novu, giving you a complete, unified view of your notification performance in the Activity Feed.
