When using Mattermost, you will have to store the integration credentials within the subscriber entity. Mattermost supports two ways to do this:

1. Using the **Mattermost Webhook** integration.
2. Using the **Mattermost Bot** integration.

### Mattermost Webhook Integration

To integrate Mattermost with your application using the Mattermost Webhook integration, follow these steps:

1. Create an incoming webhook in Mattermost. This can be done by going to the **Integrations** page and clicking on the **Incoming Webhooks** tab.
2. Click on the **Add Incoming Webhook** button and configure the webhook settings. Be sure to select the channel where you want to receive notifications.
3. Click on the **Save** button to generate a webhook URL.

Once you have the webhook URL, you can store it in the subscriber entity in your application. This will allow you to send notifications to Mattermost using the following code:

```typescript
import { Novu } from '@novu/api';
import { ChatOrPushProviderEnum } from "@novu/api/models/components";

const novu = new Novu({
  secretKey: "<NOVU_SECRET_KEY>",
  // Required if using EU region
  // serverURL: "https://eu.api.novu.co",
});

await novu.subscribers.credentials.update(
  {
    providerId: ChatOrPushProviderEnum.Mattermost,
    credentials: {
      webhookUrl: "<WEBHOOK_URL>",
    },
    integrationIdentifier: "mattermost-MnGLxp8uy",
  },
  "subscriberId"
);
```


## SDK trigger example

Send a notification to mattermost using the subscriber ID and workflow ID via `@novu/api` sdk

```typescript
await novu.trigger({
  workflowId: "workflowId",
  to: {
    subscriberId: 'subscriberId',
  },
  payload: {
    message: 'This is a notification from my application!',
  },
});
```
