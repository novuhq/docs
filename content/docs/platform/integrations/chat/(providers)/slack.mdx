When using Slack you will have to save the integration credentials in the subscriber entity.

This guide will walk you through the steps needed to obtain the `webhookUrl` that Novu requires to send chat messages to your customers.

We will provide the basic flow that the user needs to perform, to successfully send notifications via the Slack integration.

## Creating application

This step is optional, if you already have a Slack application you can reuse it.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new Slack app">
    Go to Slack's developer dashboard https://api.slack.com/apps and create a new application.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Integrating Novu with Slack

### Manually managed

To use the manually managed option, you need to generate a `webhookUrl` and plug it into your backend.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Incoming Webhooks">
    Goto 'Incoming Webhooks' in your Slack app settings and turn it on.

    ![Turn on Incoming Webhooks](/images/guides/slack-guide/on.png)

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add New Webhook">
    Click on the 'Add New Webhook to Workspace':

    ![Add New Webhook to Workspace](/images/guides/slack-guide/add.png)

  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Channel">
    Now, go ahead and select the channel in which you want to send notifications and click 'allow'.

    ![Select channel](/images/guides/slack-guide/install.png)

  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy Webhook URL">
    Copy the 'webhookUrl' from Slack.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Webhook URL">
    Now, you need to save the `webhookUrl` on the relevant subscriber entity in Novu. Here's an example to do the same using our Node SDK:

## Writing Slack content (Blocks API)

Novu Framework supports using [blocks](https://api.slack.com/block-kit) as part of the delivered messages using the provider overrides of the `chat` channel:

```typescript
await step.chat(
  'send-chat',
  async () => {
    return {
      // This will be used as a fallback for the chat provider if other than Slack provider is used
      body: 'A new post has been created',
    };
  },
  {
    providers: {
      slack: async ({ inputs }) => ({
        text: 'A new post has been created',
        blocks: [
          {
            type: 'section',
            text: {
              type: 'mrkdwn',
              text: 'A new post has been created',
            },
          },
        ],
      }),
    },
  }
);
```

## Update credential webhookUrl

<Tabs items={['Node.js', 'cURL']}>
<Tab value="Node.js">
```javascript
import {
  Novu,
  ChatProviderIdEnum
} from '@novu/node';

const novu = new Novu("<NOVU_SECRET_KEY>");

await novu.subscribers.setCredentials('subscriberId', ChatProviderIdEnum.Slack, { webhookUrl: "<WEBHOOK_URL>", });

````
</Tab>
<Tab value="cURL">
```bash
curl -L -X PUT 'https://api.novu.co/v1/subscribers/<SUBSCRIBER_ID>/credentials' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: ApiKey <NOVU_SECRET_KEY>' \
-d '{
  "providerId": "slack",
  "credentials": {
      "webhookUrl": "<WEBHOOK_URL>"
  },
  "integrationIdentifier": "slack-MnGLxp8uy"
}'
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

Checkout the [API reference](/api-reference/subscribers/subscribers-v1-controller_update-subscriber-channel) for more details.

- `subscriberId` is a custom identifier used when identifying your users within the Novu platform.
- `providerId` is a unique provider identifier. We recommend using our ChatProviderIdEnum.Slack if you're using Node, else string of Slack to specify the provider.
- The third parameter is the credentials object. In this case, we use the `webhookUrl` property to specify the webhook URL generated in the previous step.

6. You are all set up and ready to send your first chat message via our @novu/node package or directly using the REST API.

## Configuring Slack application

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure OAuth & Permissions">
    Go to OAuth & Permissions on Slack's Developer Dashboard and add your REDIRECT_URL in Redirect URLs.
    - If you use a manual Management solution, add the API endpoint you created in Step 1.
  </Step>

<Step title="Enable Incoming Webhooks">
  Go to Incoming Webhooks from the left menu and Activate Incoming Webhooks.
</Step>

  <Step title="Configure Distribution Settings">
    Go to Manage Distribution and at the bottom of the page, tick Remove Hard Coded Information and Activate Public Distribution.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Enabling HMAC Encryption

To enable Hash-Based Message Authentication Codes, you need to do the following steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable HMAC encryption">
    Visit the integration store page and enable HMAC encryption under your chat provider.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate HMAC hash">
    The next step would be to generate an HMAC encrypted subscriberId on your backend:

```jsx
import { createHmac } from 'crypto';

const hmacHash = createHmac('sha256', process.env.NOVU_SECRET_KEY)
  .update(subscriberId)
  .digest('hex');
```

</Step>

<Step title="Add HMAC to URL">
  Add the newly created hash HMAC to the Sharable URL as a query.
</Step>
</Steps>

This concludes the Slack provider guide.
