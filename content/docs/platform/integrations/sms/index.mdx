The SMS channel delivers messages to your subscribers’ mobile devices through your configured SMS provider integrations.

## How SMS delivery works in Novu

Here’s the typical flow for sending an email notification through Novu:

<Steps> 
<Step> 

### Add an email provider

Start by adding an SMS provider in the **Integration Store** on your Novu dashboard. You can connect one or more integrations for the different or the same providers.

To learn how to add an SMS provider, refer to the guide for that provider.

</Step>
<Step> 
### Add the email channel to your workflow

Next, include an SMS step in your workflow. This step defines when and how an SMS should be sent as part of your notification workflow.
</Step>
<Step> 
### Define the SMS content

Within the Email step editor, write the message body. The editor supports dynamic data for personalized content.

</Step>
<Step> 
### Store subscriber phone number

Novu automatically sends the notification to the phone number stored on the subscriber's profile . You must ensure this field is set for any subscriber who needs to receive emails. You can store or update this using the Novu dashboard, SDK or API.
</Step>
<Step>
### Trigger the workflow

Finally, trigger the workflow from your application code by sending an event to Novu.
Novu automatically resolves the subscriber, selects the correct provider, renders the email template, and delivers the message through the configured email integration.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Configuring SMS providers

When you add an SMS provider in the **Integration Store**, you'll configure settings that are common to all email providers, as well as credentials specific to that provider.

### Default sender settings

The **From** field which will displayed as the sender of the SMS is a required default setting for any email provider you connect. You can override this field during trigger time if needed.

### Provider authentication

You will also need to provide credentials specific to your email provider, such as an API key, Auth token, Account SID, username, or password. Each provider has different requirements.

## Override SMS settings

You can override the SMS settings during trigger by passing the `overrides` object. The overrides object field supports a `sms` property and `from`, `to`, `content` field overrides. This lets you send a message to a different recipient, from a different sender, or with a different content.

```javascript
import { Novu } from '@novu/api';  

const novu = new Novu({
  secretKey: "<NOVU_SECRET_KEY>",
  // Use serverURL for EU region
  // serverURL: "https://eu.api.novu.co",
});

await novu.trigger({ 
  workflowId: "workflowId",
  to: {
    subscriberId: "subscriberId",
  },
  overrides: { // [!code ++:7]
    sms: {
      to: '+123012345678',
      from: 'Novu Team',
      content: 'This SMS message is from overrides',
    },
  },
});
```

## Target a specific provider

By default, Novu uses your primary SMS provider. However, if you want to bypass this and force a specific, active integration for a trigger, use the `integrationIdentifier`.

This is useful if you have multiple active integrations for different purposes (for example, one for transactional SMS and one for security SMS). You can find the `integrationIdentifier` in the integration store page.
