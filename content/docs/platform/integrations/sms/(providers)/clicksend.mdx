You can use the [Clicksend](https://www.clicksend.com/in/) provider to send SMS messages to your customers using the Novu Platform. Let's see how to do it:

## Getting Started

To use the [Clicksend](https://www.clicksend.com/in/) provider in the SMS channel, the first step is to [create a Clicksend account](https://dashboard.clicksend.com/signup/step1) and add your API key to the Clicksend integration on the [Novu web dashboard](https://dashboard.novu.co/integrations?utm_campaign=docs-sms-clicksend).
