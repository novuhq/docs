## Getting your Sender's ID

Sender IDs allow you to brand your messages as you send them to your customers. There are two kinds of sender IDs, **shortcodes** and **alphanumerics**. The difference is that you can send and receive messages with shortcodes but only send messages with an alphanumeric.

To create a Short Code:

- On your app dashboard, click on SMS (on the menu on your left). This will display a dropdown. Click on `Shortcodes` from the dropdown options. This will also display a dropdown from which you can then click on `My Shortcodes` to view your codes. <img

- If you have not created one yet, on the `Shortcodes` dropdown option, click on `Request`. On the page that appears, fill in the form and submit. <img
