You can use the [SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/) provider to send transactional emails to your customers using the Novu Platform with a single API to create multi-channel experiences.

# Getting Started

Before you can use SNS as your SMS provider in the Novu platform, you'll need to set up an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account and configure the necessary settings. Here are the steps to get started:

- **Create an AWS Account**: If you don't already have an AWS account, you'll need to create one. You can sign up for an AWS account on the [AWS website](https://aws.amazon.com/).
- **Set Up Amazon SNS**: After you've created your AWS account, navigate to the AWS Management Console. In the Services menu, locate and click on "Simple Notification Service (SNS)." Follow the prompts to set up SNS for your account.
- **Configure SMS Preferences**: In your SNS dashboard, configure your SMS preferences. This includes setting up your sender ID and opting in for SMS messaging.
- **Create Access Keys**: To access SNS programmatically, you'll need to create AWS Access Keys. These keys are used to authenticate your integration with the Novu platform. Go to the [AWS Identity and Access Management console](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/) to create access keys.

# Create an SNS integration with Novu
