Before integrating Kannel with Novu, you should have Kannel set up and configured as an SMS gateway on your server. Let’s look at how you can do that:

## Setting up Kannel

1. First, you need to install Kannel on your server. You can download it from the [official-website](https://www.kannel.org/download.shtml) or use a package manager specific to your operating system (e.g., apt- get for Ubuntu, yum for CentOS, etc.).
2. Kannel's configuration is done through a file called kannel.conf. You need to edit this file to specify your SMS provider settings. Here's a basic configuration example:

   ```bash
   group = smsc
   smsc = smpp
   smsc-id = YourSMSCID
   host = SMSC_Hostname_or_IP
   port = SMSC_Port
   system-type = SMSC_System_Type
   smsc-username = YourUsername
   smsc-password = YourPassword
   max-pending-submits = 10
   allow-ip = "127.0.0.1"
   ```

   Replace the placeholders (e.g., **YourSMSCID**, **SMSC_Hostname_or_IP**, **SMSC_Port**, **SMSC_System_Type**, **YourUsername**, and **YourPassword**) with the actual values provided by your SMS provider.

3. You can define services that will handle incoming and outgoing SMS messages. These services specify how Kannel should process SMS requests. Here's an example of an SMS service configuration:

   ```bash
   group = sendsms-user
   username = YourUsername
   password = YourPassword
   concatenation = true
   max-messages = 3
   ```

   Adjust the settings to your needs.

4. Start Kannel with the following command:

   ```bash
   bearerbox /path/to/kannel.conf
   ```

   Make sure to replace /path/to/kannel.conf with the actual path to your Kannel configuration file.

## Creating a Kannel integration with Novu

After setting up your Kannel, follow these steps to integrate with novu:

- Visit the [Integrations Store](https://dashboard.novu.co/integrations?utm_campaign=docs-sms-kannel) on Novu.
- Click the "Add a provider" button.
- Select Kannel service.
- Choose your preferred deployment environment: `Development` or `Production`. Then Click the `Create` button.
- Once the integration is active, you'll need to configure it. This configuration usually involves providing the necessary details for Novu to connect to your Kannel SMS gateway. These details typically include:

  - **Kannel Gateway URL or IP Address**: If your Kannel SMS gateway is hosted on your server, you should use the server's IP address or hostname.
  - **Port**: The port number through which Novu should communicate with Kannel (usually 13013, or a custom port you've configured in Kannel).
  - **Username and Password**: If you've set up authentication for your Kannel SMS gateway, provide the username and password required for authentication:

  ```bash
  group = smsc
  smsc = smpp
  smsc-id = YourSMSCID
  host = SMSC_Hostname_or_IP
  port = SMSC_Port
  smsc-username = YourUsername
  smsc-password = YourPassword
  max-pending-submits = 10
  allow-ip = "127.0.0.1"
  ```

  In this example, **YourUsername** and **YourPassword** are the credentials you'd use for authentication.

- Fill in the `From` field.
- Click on the `Update` button.
- You should now be able to send notifications using Kannel in Novu.
