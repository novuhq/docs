You can create email templates in Novu using three methods:

- **Block editor**: A visual drag-and-drop editor using prebuilt content blocks and basic variables.
- **Code editor (Custom HTML)**: Full HTML and [LiquidJS](https://liquidjs.com/index.html) control for layout, logic, styling and rendering.
- **API**: Submit raw HTML and Liquid templates via the API.

## Blocks editor

The block editor is a `WYSIWYG` editor that allows you to create and edit email templates. It has two fields: `Subject` and `Body`.

- **Subject** - Title of the email. It supports variables and can be customized based on the subscriber properties and payload variables.
- **Body** - Main content of the email. It is made of blocks.

The block editor body is made of blocks. A block can be added by clicking on the plus (+) icon in the top-left corner of the editor or by adding a forward slash (`/`). In both cases, a popover will appear with the list of supported blocks. Click on the desired block to add it to the editor. The menu option next to the plus (+) icon can be used to **duplicate** or **delete** the block.

The Email Editor supports the following blocks:

- **Text** - Regular text
- **Heading 1** - Large heading (H1)
- **Heading 2** - Medium heading (H2)
- **Heading 3** - Small heading (H3)
- **Bullet List** - Bullet list (bullet points like •)
- **Numbered List** - Numbered list (numeric digits like 1,2,3)
- **Image** - Full widh image with absolute url, image position can be customized
- **Section** - Create a section to group content together
- **Column** - Creates columns to group content together, useful for responsive design
- **Divider** - Separates the content, adds a line to highlight the separation
- **Spacer** - Spacer to add space between two blocks (available in sm, lg and xl sizes)
- **Button** - Call to action button to link to a page or url (can be customised with text, url, color and size and background color)
- **Hard Break** - Adds a line break
- **Blockquote** - Adds a blockquote
- **Custom HTML code** - Insert raw HTML with variable support
- **Repeat** - Can be used for interation on array of data
- **Show** - Can be used to conditionally show content based on a condition, use eye icon to toggle the visibility of the content

### Custom HTML block

The Custom HTML block allows you to insert raw HTML inside a block editor layout.

- Supports basic HTML structure.
- Allows injecting variables using `{{ ... }}`.
- Does not support LiquidJS control structures like `{% for %}` or `{% if %}`.

Use this block when you need inline markup control within a visual layout, but don't require full Liquid logic.

### Repeat Block

`Repeat` block is synonym with the javascript language `for` loop. It can be used to iterate over an array of data and render a block for each item in the array. Use + icon or / to add a `Repeat` block. Checkout the below video on how to use `Repeat` block

  allowFullScreen></iframe>

In above video:

- `{{payload.order.items}}` is array of items in the order and can be used to iterate over the items

then each item in the iteration has following properties:

- `{{payload.order.items.name}}` is the name of the item
- `{{payload.order.items.price}}` is the price of the item

### Show Block

Show block can be used to conditionally show content based on a condition. Use the eye icon to toggle the visibility of the content. Few components supports eye icon. Conditions could be based on subscribr properties, payload variables.

  alt="Show block"
/>

In above example, if subscriber has `showTracking` field set to `true` in custom `data` attribute, then the `Track your order` button will be shown in the email sent to the subscriber. Similarly, payload variables can be used to conditionally show the content.

## Code editor (custom HTML)

The code editor provides a built-in interface for writing raw HTML and embedding Liquid expressions directly inside the Novu dashboard. This gives you full control over layout, structure, and rendering beyond the capabilities of Novu's block editor.

The editor supports advanced use cases such as:
- Migrating existing HTML email templates.
- Implementing full design systems.
- Executing flow control logic directly inside email templates.
- Complete layout and styling freedom without editor constraints.

To use it:

1. Open an email step in your workflow.
2. Select the **Code editor** tab to switch to Custom HTML mode.
3. Start writing your template using HTML and LiquidJS syntax.

<Callout type='warn'>Once you switch to the Code editor, reverting the template back to the Block editor is not supported as some HTML constructs may not map cleanly to block definitions, so further edits must be made directly in HTML.</Callout>

## Using the API

You can also submit custom HTML email templates via the Novu API. This method supports workflows where you render templates externally and use Novu purely for delivery.

During the sending phase:

- Novu compiles your submitted HTML and Liquid template using the payload and subscriber context.
- The final rendered output is what gets delivered to recipients.
- LiquidJS is executed on Novu’s servers—there’s no need to pre-render the template yourself.

This approach works well if you manage your templates in your own systems and want Novu to act as the delivery engine.

## Dynamic data sources

When authoring email templates, you can bind dynamic data from the following sources:

| Data source          | Description                                             | Available in              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Payload Schema**   | Variables defined in your workflow’s payload schema     | Block editor, Code editor and API|
| **Subscriber Data**  | Subscriber profile data associated with the recipient   | Block editor, Code editor, and API|
| **Digest Variables** | Variables that expose the results of the digest step | Block editor, Code editor, and API |
| **Local Variables**  | Variables declared within Liquid control structures (for loops, if statements)     | Code editor and API only |

## Editor autocomplete

The both block and code editors provides autocomplete as you write:

- **Block editor**: Autocompletes variable expressions (`{{ ... }}`) and shows available block types when typing `/`.
- **Code editor**: Autocompletes HTML, LiquidJS expressions, and available variables inside `{{ ... }}`.

<Callout>Autocomplete suggestions are not available inside control statements like `{% if %}` or `{% for %}`.</Callout>

## Editor preview

While editing in the editors, the template preview shows how your email will render with real or mock data.

- If your workflow defines a payload schema, Novu uses that schema to generate preview data.
- Otherwise, it falls back to using sample data from previous executions or default payloads.
- Any inline or loop-scoped variables are also evaluated during preview rendering.
