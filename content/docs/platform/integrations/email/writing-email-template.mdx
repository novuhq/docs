## Email Editor

The Email Editor is a `WYSIWYG` editor that allows you to create and edit email templates. It has two fields: `Subject` and `Body`.

- **Subject** - Title of the email. It supports variables and can be customized based on the subscriber properties and payload variables.
- **Body** - Main content of the email. It is made of blocks.

## Email Editor Blocks

Email editor body is made of blocks. A block can be added by clicking on the plus icon on the top left corner of the editor or by adding a forward slash `/`. In both the cases, a popover will appear with the list of supported blocks. Click on the desired block to add it to the editor. Menu option besides plus (+) icon can be used to **duplicate** or **delete** the block.

### Repeat Block

`Repeat` block is synonym with the javascript language `for` loop. It can be used to iterate over an array of data and render a block for each item in the array. Use + icon or / to add a `Repeat` block. Checkout the below video on how to use `Repeat` block

In above video:

- `{{payload.order.items}}` is array of items in the order and can be used to iterate over the items

then each item in the iteration has following properties:

- `{{payload.order.items.name}}` is the name of the item
- `{{payload.order.items.price}}` is the price of the item

### Show Block

Show block can be used to conditionally show content based on a condition. Use the eye icon to toggle the visibility of the content. Few components supports eye icon. Conditions could be based on subscribr properties, payload variables.

In above example, if subscriber has `showTracking` field set to `true` in custom `data` attribute, then the `Track your order` button will be shown in the email sent to the subscriber. Similarly, payload variables can be used to conditionally show the content.
