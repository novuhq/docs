The Email Channel is a critical component for delivering notifications reliably. Whether it's a password reset, an onboarding email, or an alert about account activity, email remains a trusted medium for reaching users.
Novu simplifies this process, allowing you to focus on implementation rather than infrastructure.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Provider Support**: Integrate any major provider like SendGrid, SES, or Mailgun
- **Failover Mechanisms**: Automatically retry with a backup provider to ensure reliability
- **Customizable Templates**: Leverage templates with dynamic placeholders to personalize messages
- **Delivery Insights (Coming Soon)**: Track delivery status, open rates, and more in the Novu dashboard

## Common Use Cases

- **Transactional Emails**: Password resets, account verification, purchase confirmations
- **System Alerts**: Security notifications, system updates
- **Engagement Emails**: Onboarding, reminders, promotional updates

Novu can be used to deliver email messages to your subscribers using a unified delivery API. You can easily integrate your favorite email provider using the built-in integration store.

## Configuring email providers

When creating an email provider integration you will be asked to provide additional fields alongside the provider-specific credentials:

- **Sender name** - Will be displayed as the sender of the message
- **From email address** - Emails sent using Novu will be sent using this address

For some email providers including SendGrid you will have to authenticate the **From email address** to make sure you will send email messages using an authorized address.

## Sending Email Overrides

The overrides field supports an email property. The email overrides field have properties like `to`, `from`, `senderName` etc

  // Use serverURL for EU region

});

  workflowId: "workflowId",
  to: {

  },
  overrides: {
    email: {

      text: 'text version of email using overrides',
      replyTo: 'no-reply@novu.co',
      cc: ['1@novu.co'],
      bcc: ['2@novu.co'],
    },
  },
});
```

<Callout type="info">
It's very important to know that Novu merges the `to` field in the email overrides with the subscriber email. It DOES NOT REPLACE IT.

## Sending Email attachments

You can easily send attachments with the Novu API by passing the attachments array when triggering an Email based workflow. Attachment file can either be in the `buffer` or `base64` format. There is total limit of 20 mb for all attachments included and email size.

## Using different email integration

In Novu integration store, multiple email channel type provider integrations can be active at the same time. But only one provider integration can be primary at a time. This primary integration will be used as a provider to deliver the email by default. If you want to use a different active provider integration then you can use the `integrationIdentifier` email overrides field.

If there are 4 active email integrations with these identifiers:

1. sendgrid-abcdef
2. sendgrid-ghijkl
3. brevo-abcdef
4. mailersend-abcdef

Here, if `sendgrid-abcdef` is primary integration and you want to use `brevo-abcdef` with this trigger then you can use `integrationIdentifier` email overrides field as below:

<Tabs items={['Node.js']}>
<Tab value="Node.js">
```javascript
import { Novu } from '@novu/api';

const novu = new Novu({
  secretKey: "<NOVU_SECRET_KEY>",
  // Use serverURL for EU region
  // serverURL: "https://eu.api.novu.co",
});

await novu.trigger({
  workflowId: "workflowId",
  to: {
    subscriberId: "subscriberId",
  },
  overrides: {
    email: {
      integrationIdentifier: "brevo-abcdef"
    },
  },
});
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="info">
Integration identifier is similar to Provider identifier but it is different than Provider Id. It is unique for each integration. You can find the `integrationIdentifier` in the integration store page.
