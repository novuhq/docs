Email providers are the services that deliver notifications to your subscribers’ email. You must set up each provider individually in the Novu dashboard to enable delivery through the Email channel.

Novu provides a unified integration layer that connects your workflows to these email providers. Once you’ve added your integrations, Novu handles routing and delivery automatically, sending each email through the correct provider without requiring additional setup. This allows you to manage multiple email integrations and switch providers when needed.

## Key features

- **Multi-provider support**: Integrate any major provider like SendGrid, SES, or Mailgun.
- **Failover mechanisms**: Automatically retry with a backup provider to ensure reliability.
- **Activity tracking**: Track delivery status, open rates, and more in the Novu dashboard.

## How email works in Novu

Here’s the typical flow for sending an email notification through Novu:

<Steps> 
<Step> 

### Add an email provider

Start by adding an email provider in the **Integration Store** on your Novu dashboard. You can connect one or more integrations for different or the same providers.

To learn how to add an email provider, refer to the guide for the [supported providers](/platform/integrations/email#supported-providers).

</Step>
<Step> 
### Add the Email channel to your workflow

Next, include an Email step in a workflow. This step defines when and how an email should be sent as part of your notification workflow.
</Step>
<Step> 
### Define the email content

Within the Email step, you can design your message using the built-in visual editor or code editor. Novu supports dynamic data from your payload, so each message can be personalized for the subscriber.
</Step>
<Step> 
### Store subscriber email addresses

Novu automatically sends the notification to the email address stored on the subscriber's profile. This profile is update either using the Novu dashboard or API.
</Step>
<Step>
### Trigger the workflow

[Trigger the workflow](/api-reference/events/trigger-event) from your application code by sending an event to Novu. Novu automatically:
1. Resolves the subscriber.
2. Selects the correct provider.
3. Renders the email template. 
4. Delivers the message through the configured email integration.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Configuring email providers

When you add an email provider in the **Integration Store**, you configure settings that are common to all email providers, as well as credentials specific to that provider.

### Default sender settings

Novu asks for two default settings for any email provider you connect:

- **Sender name**: The name that appears in the recipient's "From" field.
- **From email address**: The email address the notification is sent from. For some email providers, including SendGrid, you must authenticate the **From email address** to make sure you're sending an email from an authorized address.

These are the default values used for every email sent via this integration. You can override them when triggering a workflow if needed.

### Provider authentication

You must provide credentials specific to your email provider for a successful integration.

<Callout type="info">For detailed setup guides for each integration, refer to the [Supported Providers](/platform/integrations/email#supported-providers) list at the bottom of this page.</Callout>

## Advanced email features

You can control advanced email features at runtime by passing data in your trigger call. This lets you send attachments, override default settings, or target a specific provider for a single notification.

### Sending attachments

You can send attachments by passing an `attachments` array in the `payload` of your trigger. The attachment file can be provided as a `buffer` or a `base64` encoded string.

There is a total limit of 20MB for all attachments included in an email.

```

### Sending email overrides

You can override the email settings for a single trigger by passing an `overrides` object. This lets you override the following fields:
- `bcc`
- `cc`
- `from` address
- `replyTo`
- `senderName`
- `text`
- `to` address

<Tabs items={['Node.js']}>
<Tab value="Node.js">
```javascript
import { Novu } from '@novu/api';

const novu = new Novu({
  secretKey: "<NOVU_SECRET_KEY>",
  // Required if using EU region
  // serverURL: "https://eu.api.novu.co",
});

await novu.trigger({    
  workflowId: "workflowId",
  to: {
    subscriberId: "subscriberId",
  },
  overrides: { // [!code ++:11]
    email: {
      to: ['to@novu.co'],
      from: 'from@novu.co',
      senderName: 'Novu Team',
      text: 'text version of email using overrides',
      replyTo: 'no-reply@novu.co',
      cc: ['1@novu.co'],
      bcc: ['2@novu.co'],
    },
  },
});
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="info">Note that Novu merges the `to` field in the email overrides with the subscriber email. It does _not_ replace it.</Callout>

### Targeting a specific provider

By default, Novu uses your primary email provider. However, if you want to bypass this and force a specific, active integration for a trigger, use the `integrationIdentifier`.

This is useful if you have multiple active integrations for different purposes. For example, you might have one integration for transactional emails and one for marketing emails. You can find the `integrationIdentifier` for each provider in provider page in the **Integration Store**.

<Tabs items={['Node.js']}>
<Tab value="Node.js">
```javascript
import { Novu } from '@novu/api';

const novu = new Novu({
  secretKey: "<NOVU_SECRET_KEY>",
  // Required if using EU region
  // serverURL: "https://eu.api.novu.co",
});

await novu.trigger({
  workflowId: "workflowId",
  to: {
    subscriberId: "subscriberId",
  },
  overrides: {
    email: {
      integrationIdentifier: "brevo-abcdef" // [!code ++]
    },
  },
});
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Overriding email layout 
Each Novu environment can have multiple layouts. Each email step in the workflow can have a layout assigned to it. Overriding the email layout allows you to dynamically override layout settings at trigger time, providing flexible layout management per workflow/channel or per step execution.

**`layoutId` values and its behavior:**

| Value | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| "layout-identifier" | Uses layout with this identifier |
| "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011" | Uses layout with this MongoDB ObjectId |
| null | Explicitly no layout - renders email without any layout |
| undefined | Default behavior - uses step's configured layout or environment default |
| Not specified | Same as undefined |

**Precedence rules:**

1. **Step-level override** - **Highest priority**
2. **Workflow-level/channels-level override**
3. **Step configuration** (configured in workflow editor)
4. **Environment default layout** - **Lowest priority**


<Tabs items={['Node.js']}>
<Tab value="Node.js">
```typescript
import { Novu } from '@novu/api';

const novu = new Novu({
  secretKey: "<NOVU_SECRET_KEY>",
  // Required if using EU region
  // serverURL: "https://eu.api.novu.co",
});

await novu.trigger({
  workflowId: "workflowId",
  to: {
    subscriberId: "subscriberId",
  },
  payload: {},
  overrides: {
    // Channel-level layouts
    channels: {
	    email: {
		    layoutId: 'black-friday-layout',
	    },
	  },
    steps: {
      'welcome-email': {
        // This email step uses a specific welcome layout
        layoutId: 'welcome-v2'
      },
      'promotional-email': {
        // This email uses the channel-level layout (black-friday-layout)
        // No layoutId specified = inherits from channel level
      },
      'transactional-receipt': {
        // This email explicitly uses no layout (plain email)
        layoutId: null
      }
    }
  }
});
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Sending provider specific extra fields

You can send provider specific extra fields by passing a `_passthrough` object in the `overrides` object. This lets you send extra fields to the provider SDK. Novu internally uses provider's official SDK to send the email. Each provider has its own supported extra fields. Those extra fields are not validated by Novu and are passed directly to the provider SDK. There are three type of fields that you can send: `body`, `headers`, and `query`. Below is an example of sending `tags` supported by [Resend provider](/platform/integrations/email/resend).

<Tabs items={['Node.js']}>
<Tab value="Node.js">
```typescript
import { Novu } from '@novu/api';

const novu = new Novu({
  secretKey: "<NOVU_SECRET_KEY>",
  // Required if using EU region
  // serverURL: "https://eu.api.novu.co",
});

await novu.trigger({
  workflowId: "workflowId",
  to: {
    subscriberId: "subscriberId",
  },
  payload: {},
  overrides: {
    // [!code ++:20]
    providers: {
      resend: {
        _passthrough: {
          body: {
            tags: [
              {
                name: "category",
                value: "confirm_email"
              }
            ] 
          },
          headers: {
            "X-Custom-Header": "custom-header-value"
          },
          query: {
            "queryParam": "queryValue"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
});
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Unsubscribe email 

By default, Novu does not add any unsubscribe links to the email. Few providers add unsubscribe links to the email by default. If you are looking to add custom unsubscribe links to the email, follow below steps:

- Add `{{payload.unsubscribeEmail}}` field in the email editor. 
- Build custom unsubscribe link in your application using subscriberId workflowId. Make sure this link is secured with tokens to prevent abuse.
- Use Novu [preference api](/api-reference/subscribers/update-subscriber-preferences) to update the email channel preferences for this workflow to `false`.
- Optionally, you can build a custom unsubscribe page and add the link of that page for unsubscribe email option.
- Send the value of `unsubscribeEmail` variable in the payload while triggering the workflow.
- Novu will add the unsubscribe link to the email and end user will be able to unsubscribe from the email by clicking on the link.
