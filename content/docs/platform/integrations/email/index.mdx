Email providers are the services that deliver notifications to your subscribers’ email. Each provider must be set up individually in the Novu dashboard to enable delivery through the Email channel.

Novu provides a unified integration layer that connects your workflows to these email providers. Once you’ve added your integrations, Novu handles routing and delivery automatically, sending each email through the correct provider without requiring additional setup. This makes it easy to manage multiple email integrations, and switch providers when needed.

## Key features

- **Multi-provider support**: Integrate any major provider like SendGrid, SES, or Mailgun
- **Failover mechanisms**: Automatically retry with a backup provider to ensure reliability
- **Activity tracking**: Track delivery status, open rates, and more in the Novu dashboard

## How Email works in Novu

Here’s the typical flow for sending an email notification through Novu:

<Steps> 

<Step> 

### Add an email provider

Start by adding an email provider in the **Integration Store** on your Novu dashboard. You can connect one or more integrations for the different or the same providers.

To learn how to add an email provider, refer to the guide for the supported providers.

</Step>
<Step> 
### Add the email channel to your workflow

Next, include an Email step in a workflow. This step defines when and how an email should be sent as part of your notification workflow.
</Step>
<Step> 
### Define the email content

Within the Email step, you can design your message using the built-in visual editor or code editor (for custom HTML and templating with LiquidJS).
Novu supports dynamic data from your payload, so each message can be personalized for the subscriber.
</Step>
<Step> 
### Store subscriber email addresses

Novu automatically sends the notification to the email address stored on the . You must ensure this field is set for any subscriber who needs to receive emails. You can store or update this using the Novu dashboard, SDK or API.
</Step>
<Step>
### Trigger the workflow

Finally, trigger the workflow from your application code by sending an event to Novu.
Novu automatically resolves the subscriber, selects the correct provider, renders the email template, and delivers the message through the configured email integration.
</Step>

## Configuring email providers

When you add an email provider in the **Integration Store**, you'll configure settings that are common to all email providers, as well as credentials specific to that provider.

### Default sender settings

Novu asks for two default settings for any email provider you connect:

* **Sender Name**: The name that will appear in the recipient's "From" field.
* **From Email Address**: The email address the notification will be sent from. For some email providers including SendGrid you will have to authenticate the **From email address** to make sure you're sending an email from an authorized address.

These are the default values used for every email sent via this integration. You can override them at trigger time if needed.

### Provider authentication

You will also need to provide credentials specific to your email provider, such as an API Key, Secret, or Region. Each provider has different requirements.

<Callout type="info"> See the Supported Providers list at the bottom of this page for detailed setup guides for each integration. </Callout>

### Setting up failover

Novu ensures high deliverability with an automatic failover system. You can have multiple active email providers in the same environment.

* Primary integration: You must designate one of your active providers as the primary provider. Novu will always attempt to send the email using this provider first.
* Failover logic: If the Primary provider fails to send the notification (e.g., its API is down or it returns an error), Novu will automatically retry sending the email through one of your other Active providers.

This built-in redundancy means you don't have to manage provider downtime yourself.

## Advanced email features

You can control advanced email features at runtime by passing data in your trigger call. This lets you send attachments, override default settings, or even target a specific provider for a single notification.

### Sending attachments

You can send attachments by passing an `attachments` array in the `payload` of your trigger. The attachment file can be provided as a `buffer` or a `base64` encoded string.

There is a total limit of 20MB for all attachments included in an email.

### Sending email overrides

You can override the email settings for a single trigger by passing an `overrides` object. This lets you change the `to` address, `senderName`, `from` address, and more.

```javascript
import { Novu } from '@novu/api';

const novu = new Novu({
  secretKey: "<NOVU_SECRET_KEY>",
  // Use serverURL for EU region
  // serverURL: "https://eu.api.novu.co",
});

await novu.trigger({    
  workflowId: "workflowId",
  to: {
    subscriberId: "subscriberId",
  },
  overrides: { // [!code ++:11]
    email: {
      to: ['to@novu.co'],
      from: 'from@novu.co',
      senderName: 'Novu Team',
      text: 'text version of email using overrides',
      replyTo: 'no-reply@novu.co',
      cc: ['1@novu.co'],
      bcc: ['2@novu.co'],
    },
  },
});
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="info">It's very important to know that Novu merges the `to` field in the email overrides with the subscriber email. It does not replace it.</Callout>

### Targeting a specific provider

By default, Novu uses your primary email provider. However, if you want to bypass this and force a specific, active integration for a trigger, use the `integrationIdentifier`.

This is useful if you have multiple active integrations for different purposes (for example, one for transactional emails and one for marketing emails). You can find the `integrationIdentifier` in the integration store page.

<Tabs items={['Node.js']}>
<Tab value="Node.js">
```javascript
import { Novu } from '@novu/api';

const novu = new Novu({
  secretKey: "<NOVU_SECRET_KEY>",
  // Use serverURL for EU region
  // serverURL: "https://eu.api.novu.co",
});

await novu.trigger({
  workflowId: "workflowId",
  to: {
    subscriberId: "subscriberId",
  },
  overrides: {
    email: {
      integrationIdentifier: "brevo-abcdef" // [!code ++]
    },
  },
});
```
