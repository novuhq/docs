You can use the [Netcore](https://netcorecloud.com/) provider to send transactional emails to your customers using the Novu Platform with a single API to create multi-channel experiences.

## Getting Started

To use the Netcore provider in the email channel, you will need to create a Netcore account and add your API key to the Netcore integration on the Novu platform.

## Generating an API Key

To generate a new API key in Netcore, you can follow these steps:

- [Log in](https://email.netcorecloud.com/) to your Netcore account.
- Go to the **Integration** page under the **Settings** menu and click on the **API** tab.
- The API Key is hidden for security purposes. Click Show. The system will prompt you to enter your account password. Once you enter the password, the API key will be accessible.

## Setting up sending domains

To start sending emails, you need to add and verify your sending domains. You can either use your top-level domain (e.g. my-company.com) or a sub-domain like email.my-company.com. The verification is done to ensure your sending domain’s security.

Follow the instructions on this [page](https://emaildocs.netcorecloud.com/docs/what-is-a-sending-domain-how-to-set-up-sending-domains) to get started

## Creating a Netcore integration with Novu

- Visit the [Integrations](https://dashboard.novu.co/integrations?utm_campaign=docs-netcore) page on Novu.
- Click on Add a Provider.
- Select Netcore service.
- Enter your Netcore API Key.
- Fill in the `From email address` field using the authenticated email from the previous step.
- Fill in the `Sender's name`.
- Click on the `Disabled` button and mark it as `Active`.
- Click on the **Update** button.
- You should now be able to send notifications using Netcore in Novu.
