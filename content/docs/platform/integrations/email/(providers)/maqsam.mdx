You can use the [Maqsam](https://maqsam.com/) provider to send SMS messages to your customers using the Novu platform with a single API to create multi-channel experiences.

# Getting Started

To use the Maqsam provider in the sms channel, you will need to create a Maqsam account and add your access key & secret to the Maqsam integration on the Novu platform.
