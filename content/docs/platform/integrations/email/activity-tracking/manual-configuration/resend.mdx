Resend does not currently support auto-configuration of webhooks through their API. To track events in Novu, youâ€™ll need to set up the webhook manually in your Resend dashboard.

## Step 1: Get your webhook URL from Novu

First, you need the unique webhook URL from your Novu dashboard that will receive events from Resend.

1. Navigate to the **Integration Store** page in Novu and select your **Resend** integration.
2. Enable the **Email Activity Tracking** toggle.
3. A unique Inbound Webhook URL will be displayed. Click the **copy** icon to copy it.

## Step 2: Create the webhook in Resend

Next, log in to your Resend dashboard to create the webhook.

1. From the sidebar menu of your Resend dashboard, click on **Webhooks**.
2. On the webhooks page, click **Add webhook**.

3. In the menu that appears, configure the following:
    - **Endpoint URL:** Paste the **Inbound Webhook URL** you copied from Novu.
    - **Events to send:** Select **Email** to subscribe to all email events.

4.  Click **Add** to create the webhook.

Your Resend account will now forward email events to Novu, where they will appear in the Activity Feed and the execution details in the event logs.

## Step 3: Add the signing secret (Recommended)

For a more secure and authenticated connection, you should add the webhook's signing secret back into Novu. This step is optional but highly recommended.

1. After creating the webhook in Resend, you will get **Signing Secret**. Copy this secret.

2. Return to your Resend integration settings in Novu.
3. Under the **Email Activity Tracking** section, paste the secret into the **Inbound Webhook Signing Key** field.

4.  Click **Save Changes**.
