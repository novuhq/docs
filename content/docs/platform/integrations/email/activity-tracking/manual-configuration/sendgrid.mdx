If the API key used in your Novu SendGrid integration does not have the required permissions, the automatic setup will fail with an `access forbidden` error. This indicates that Novu lacks the permissions needed to configure the webhook on your behalf.

This guide will walk you through resolving this issue.

## Step 1: Update SendGrid API key permissions

First, you need to update your API key in your SendGrid account to grant the necessary permissions.

1. Log in to your SendGrid account.
2. Under **Settings**, click **API Keys**.
3. Choose whether to edit an existing key or create a new one:
   - To create a new API key, click **Create API Key**.
   - To update an existing key, click the settings icon next to it and select **Edit API Key**.

4. Set the key permissions to either:
   - **Full Access**, or
   - Custom Access with at least the following enabled:  
     - **Mail Send**
     - **Mail Settings**

5. If you created a new key, return to the Novu dashboard and update your SendGrid integration settings with the new API key.

## Step 2: Enable activity tracking in Novu
Once your API key has the correct permissions, return to your Novu dashboard to complete the setup.

1.  Navigate to the **Integrations** page and select your **SendGrid** integration.
2.  Click the **Email Activity Tracking** toggle to enable it.

With the updated permissions, Novu should now successfully auto-configure the webhook for you. You should see a green checkmark indicating that the webhook is active. If you see this, your setup is complete.

## Step 3: Handle configuration error (Optional)

In rare cases, even with the correct permissions, you might still see a `Error configuring SendGrid webhook: access forbidden` or `Error configuring SendGrid webhook: Webhook already exists. Please provide unique URL` error message in the Novu UI after enabling the toggle. However, the webhook may have been successfully created in SendGrid.

If this happens, follow these steps to manually link the webhook:

1. Log in to the SendGrid dashboard.  
2. Go to **Settings**, and click **Mail Settings**.
3. Under **Webhook Settings**, click **Event Webhook**.
4. You should see that the webhook was already created successfully in SendGrid despite the error.  
5. Copy the **Endpoint URL** from this page and return back to the Novu dashboard.

6. Go to your Novu SendGrid integration settings, under **Email Activity Tracking**, paste the Endpoint URL into the **Inbound Webhook Signing Key** field. 
7. Click **Save**.

This will manually link the existing webhook to your Novu integration and resolve the issue.
