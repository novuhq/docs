# Novu MCP Server

Enable AI agents to securely access and interact with your Novu notification infrastructure using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## What is Model Context Protocol?

MCP is a protocol that enables AI tools and applications to connect with external services in a secure, standardized way. With Novu's MCP server, your AI assistants can:

* **Query notification data** - Find subscribers, workflows, and notification history
* **Manage preferences** - Update subscriber notification settings  
* **Trigger workflows** - Send notifications through AI interactions
* **Debug issues** - Investigate delivery problems and analyze performance

## How It Works

Novu hosts a remote MCP server that provides secure access to your notification infrastructure:

1. **Connect** your AI assistant to Novu's MCP server using your API key
2. **Authenticate** with your workspace permissions and region settings
3. **Interact** through natural language with your notification system
4. **Manage** subscribers, workflows, and preferences seamlessly

**Connection Details:**
- **US Region**: `https://mcp.novu.co/mcp` 
- **EU Region**: `https://mcp.novu.co/mcp?region=eu`
