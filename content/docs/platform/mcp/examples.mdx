<Callout type="info">
These examples assume you've already [configured your AI assistant](/platform/mcp/getting-started) with the Novu MCP server.
</Callout>

## Customer Support Scenarios

### Investigating Delivery Issues

<Tabs items={['Email Not Received', 'SMS Delivery Problems', 'Push Notification Issues']}>
<Tab value="Email Not Received">

**Customer Report**: "I'm not receiving my password reset emails"

**Investigation Flow**:
```
1. "Find subscriber with email customer@example.com"
2. "Show their email notifications from the last 24 hours"
3. "Check their email preferences and any global opt-outs"
4. "Show details for the 'password-reset' workflow configuration"
```

**Follow-up Actions**:
- If no notifications found: Check if workflow triggered correctly
- If notifications failed: Review execution logs for error details
- If preferences disabled: Guide customer to re-enable email notifications

</Tab>
<Tab value="SMS Delivery Problems">

**Customer Report**: "Not getting SMS verification codes"

**Investigation**:
```
"Find subscriber with phone +1234567890 and show their SMS notifications from today, including any delivery failures"
```

**Common Resolution**:
```
"Check subscriber preferences for SMS channel and show the 'sms-verification' workflow trigger conditions"
```

</Tab>
<Tab value="Push Notification Issues">

**Customer Report**: "Mobile app notifications stopped working"

**Investigation**:
```
"Find subscriber customer@example.com and show their push notifications from the last week, focusing on delivery status"
```

**Device Token Check**:
```
"Show subscriber preferences and check if push notification tokens are current"
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Managing Subscriber Preferences

#### Handling Unsubscribe Requests

**Customer Request**: "Stop sending me marketing emails but keep order updates"

**Solution**:
```
1. "Find subscriber customer@example.com"
2. "Show their current notification preferences"
3. "Update subscriber [subscriber-id] to disable email for 'marketing-newsletter' workflow only"
4. "Confirm the preference update was successful"
```

#### Bulk Preference Analysis

**Support Task**: Understand admin user preferences across the platform

**Approach**:
```
1. "Find all subscribers with 'admin' in their email"
2. "Show notification preferences for the first 5 admin users"
3. "Identify common preference patterns"
```

## Development & Testing Workflows

### Pre-Production Testing

<Steps>
<Step title="Workflow Validation">
```
"Show details for the 'welcome-series' workflow including payload structure and trigger conditions"
```
Understand the workflow before testing.
</Step>

<Step title="Test Execution">
```
"Trigger the 'welcome-series' workflow for subscriber test.user@example.com with payload: {
  'firstName': 'Test',
  'lastName': 'User',
  'signupDate': '2024-01-15'
}"
```
Execute test with realistic data.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify Results">
```
"Show recent notifications for test.user@example.com to confirm delivery across all channels"
```
Validate multi-channel delivery.
</Step>

<Step title="Check Logs">
```
"If any notifications failed, show detailed execution logs for troubleshooting"
```
Debug any issues immediately.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Debugging Failed Workflows

#### Systematic Error Investigation

**Issue**: High failure rate on 'order-confirmation' workflow

**Debugging Process**:
```
1. "Show all failed notifications for 'order-confirmation' workflow from the last 24 hours"
2. "Get detailed execution logs for the first 3 failures"
3. "Show the workflow payload structure to identify missing data"
4. "Find a successful execution from the same period for comparison"
```

#### Payload Validation

**Issue**: Workflow triggers but notifications are malformed

**Validation Steps**:
```
1. "Show the 'email-digest' workflow configuration and required payload fields"
2. "Find recent successful triggers and show their payload data"
3. "Compare with failed executions to identify data inconsistencies"
```

## Operations & Monitoring

### Performance Analytics

#### Workflow Success Rate Analysis

**Monthly Review Task**:
```
"Analyze all notifications from the 'user-onboarding' workflow in the last 30 days and calculate success rates by channel"
```

**Failure Pattern Identification**:
```
"Show failed SMS notifications from the last week, grouped by error type and time of day"
```

#### Subscriber Engagement Tracking

**Engagement Analysis**:
```
"Find 10 random active subscribers and analyze their notification interaction patterns across channels"
```

**Preference Trends**:
```
"Show preference changes in the last month - how many users disabled vs enabled each channel type"
```

### Environment Management

#### Production vs Development Comparison

**Workflow Sync Check**:
```
"List all workflows in development environment and compare active status with production"
```

**Configuration Validation**:
```
"Show 'payment-confirmation' workflow details in both development and production environments"
```

## Advanced Integration Scenarios

### Customer Journey Analysis

#### Complete Subscriber Lifecycle

**Comprehensive Review**:
```
Sequence:
1. "Find subscriber longtime.customer@example.com"
2. "Show their complete notification history from the last 90 days"
3. "Group notifications by workflow to understand their journey"
4. "Show their current preferences and when they were last updated"
5. "Identify any preference changes during this period"
```

**Use Case**: Understanding customer engagement evolution over time

#### Workflow Performance Deep Dive

**Performance Analysis**:
```
Multi-step analysis:
1. "Show 'abandoned-cart' workflow details and trigger conditions"
2. "Find all notifications from this workflow in the last 14 days"
3. "Calculate delivery success rates by channel (email, SMS, push)"
4. "Show top 5 most recent failures with detailed error logs"
5. "Compare performance with 'checkout-complete' workflow for context"
```

### Support Ticket Integration

#### Ticket-Driven Investigation

**Support Scenario**: Ticket #4567 - "Customer says they're getting duplicate emails"

**Investigation Workflow**:
```
1. "Find subscriber from-ticket-email@example.com"
2. "Show their email notifications from the last 7 days, grouped by workflow"
3. "Look for duplicate triggers or execution issues"
4. "Check for any integration issues causing multiple triggers"
5. "Review their subscription status across different workflows"
```

#### Proactive Issue Detection

**Daily Health Check**:
```
"Find all subscribers who received more than 10 notifications yesterday and review for potential spam issues"
```

**Systematic Review**:
```
"Show all failed notifications from the last hour across all workflows to identify system-wide issues"
```

## Business Intelligence Use Cases

### Campaign Performance

#### Email Campaign Analysis

**Marketing Campaign Review**:
```
"Analyze the 'monthly-newsletter' workflow performance for the last 30 days, including open rates and delivery success"
```

**A/B Testing Support**:
```
"Compare notification delivery patterns between 'welcome-email-v1' and 'welcome-email-v2' workflows"
```

#### Channel Effectiveness

**Multi-Channel Analysis**:
```
"Show delivery success rates across all channels for high-volume workflows to identify the most reliable channels"
```

**Regional Performance**:
```
"Find all SMS notifications from the last week and analyze delivery success by subscriber location data"
```

### Data-Driven Optimization

#### Subscriber Segmentation

**High-Value Customer Analysis**:
```
"Find subscribers with 'premium' in their email and analyze their notification engagement patterns"
```

**Churn Prevention**:
```
"Identify subscribers who haven't received notifications in 30+ days and check their preference status"
```

## Common Prompt Patterns

### Efficient Query Templates

**Customer Support**:
```
"Find subscriber [email/phone/id] and show their [timeframe] [channel] notifications including [specific-focus]"
```

**Development**:
```
"Show workflow '[name]' details and test with subscriber '[test-email]' using payload [test-data]"
```

**Operations**:
```
"Analyze [workflow-name] performance for [timeframe] and show [success-rates/failures/patterns]"
```

**Troubleshooting**:
```
"Find [failed/successful] [channel] notifications from [timeframe] and show [logs/patterns/causes]"
```
