You can replace the default notification bell, manage the popover's visibility state, and even integrate with a third-party popover component from a library like Radix UI or ShadCN.

## Replace the default Bell Icon

Use the `renderBell` prop to replace the default bell icon and unread count indicator with your own custom component. The function receives the `unreadCount` as an argument.


## Control the popover's visibility



## Build a completely custom popover
