By default, Novu sanitizes the `subject` and `body` of all in-app step notifications to ensure that they are safe to display. This process prevents security risks by removing suspicious HTML tags (like `<script>`) and escaping HTML entities (like `&`, `<`, `>`).

However, you can disable this feature to display richly formatted content with links, bold text, and more. The Inbox component supports this by letting you inject HTML using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` into your notification content, providing control over layout, formatting, and design.

<Callout type="warn">Disabling content sanitization can expose your application to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. You should only enable this feature if you completely trust the source of your notification data and have full control over the trigger payload.</Callout>

Enabling HTML formatting is a two-step process: you must first disable sanitization in your Novu workflow and then use the appropriate render prop in your application to display the HTML.

## Step 1: Disable content sanitization in your workflow

In your Novu workflow:
1. navigate to the **In-App editor**.
2. In the editor, find and turn on the **Disable content sanitization** toggle.

This setting instructs the Novu API to send the raw, unescaped HTML content for both the subject and body to your application.

## Step 2: Display the HTML in your app

Once sanitization is disabled, you must use a `render` prop in your application to correctly interpret and display the raw HTML. Use React's `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` property for this purpose.

### For the notification body

To display HTML in the notification's body, use the `renderBody` prop.

```tsx
import { Inbox } from '@novu/react';

function CustomInbox() {
  return (
    <Inbox
      applicationIdentifier="YOUR_APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER"
      subscriberId="YOUR_SUBSCRIBER_ID"
      renderBody={(notification) => (
        <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: notification.body }} />
      )}
    />
  );
}

export default CustomInbox;
```

#### Example usage

If your workflow's in-app message body contains the following content with HTML tags and variables:

```html html tags with dynamic values
{{subscriber.firstName}}, A <b>Good news!</b> We've just launched the <i>advanced
analytics dashboard</i> you asked for. Check it out <a href="[https://example.com](https://example.com)"
target="_blank">here</a>.
```

When you trigger this notification, the code will render this content with the HTML formatting applied, displaying bold and italic text, and a functional link.

### For the notification subject

Similarly, to display HTML in the notification's subject, use the `renderSubject` prop.

```tsx
import { Inbox } from '@novu/react';

function CustomInbox() {
  return (
    <Inbox
      applicationIdentifier="YOUR_APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER"
      subscriberId="YOUR_SUBSCRIBER_ID"
      renderSubject={(notification) => (
        <span dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: notification.subject }} />
      )}
    />
  );
}

export default CustomInbox;
```

### For the notification subject and body

If you need to display HTML in both the subject and body, use the `renderNotification` prop.

```tsx
import { Inbox } from '@novu/react';

function CustomInbox() {
  return (
    <Inbox
      applicationIdentifier="YOUR_APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER"
      subscriberId="YOUR_SUBSCRIBER_ID"
      renderNotification={(notification) => (
        <div style={{ borderBottom: '1px solid #eee', padding: '16px' }}>
          <h3 dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: notification.subject }} />
          <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: notification.body }} />
        </div>
      )}
    />
  );
}

export default CustomInbox;
```
