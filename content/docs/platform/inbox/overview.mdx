## Composable architecture

The Novu Inbox is built with a composable architecture. It is composed of other sub-components:

- `<InboxContent />` – Renders the content of the `<Inbox />` popover.
- `<Preferences />` – Manages subscriber notification preferences.
- `<Bell />` – Shows an unread counter and opens the inbox.
- `<Notifications />` – Display the list of notifications.

## How it works

At a high level, the Inbox abstracts away the complexity of building a notification center.

1. When you drop the Inbox component into your application, it securely connects to Novu's services.
2. It automatically fetches user notifications and manages the real-time unread count displayed on the bell icon.
3. When a user clicks the bell, it presents the list of notifications and user preferences.
4. All user interactions, such as marking a notification as read or changing a preference, are automatically synchronized with the Novu backend in real-time.

## Ways to implement the Novu Inbox

There are two integration approaches, depending on your needs for speed versus customization.
