Multi-tenancy in Novu lets you isolate notifications for different organizations, environments, or workspaces within the same Novu project. Instead of creating separate subscribers or workflows for each tenant, you can use [Contexts](/platform/workflow/contexts) to define and manage tenant boundaries.

<Callout>This guide assumes you already understand what Contexts are. If not, start with the [Contexts](/platform/workflow/contexts) documentation.</Callout>

## How multi-tenancy works in Novu

Multi-tenancy in Novu is built on top of Contexts, which act as lightweight tags that group notifications by logical boundaries such as tenants, workspaces, or environments.

When a notification is triggered with a tenant context, Novu automatically associates all notifications and preferences with that tenant. The same tenant context passed to the <Method href="/platform/inbox/configuration/inbox-with-context">{`<Inbox />`}</Method> filters notifications for that specific organization, ensuring users only see messages relevant to their workspace.

## How to implement multi-tenancy in Novu

Implementing a multi-tenant system involves a few key steps:

### Define a tenant context

A Tenant Context is a JSON object that identifies a specific tenant and can store any related data you need, such as company name, logo, or plan type.

You can create a tenant context using the Novu dashboard, API or from the <Method href="/platform/inbox/configuration/inbox-with-context">{`<Inbox />`}</Method>. if it doesn’t already exist, Novu automatically creates it.

Here are ways you can pass context:

```jsx
// Simple tenant ID

context: {
  tenant: 'acme-corp' 
}

// Rich tenant object

context: {
  tenant: {
    id: 'acme-corp',
    data: {
      name: 'Acme Corporation',
      logo: 'https://cdn.acme.com/logo.png'
    }
  }
}
```

You can also manage all tenant contexts centrally from the Novu dashboard or API.

<Callout>To learn more about creating, updating, and deleting contexts, see the [Manage Contexts](/platform/workflow/contexts) guide.</Callout>

### Applying tenant context in workflows

Once you’ve defined your tenant context, you can use it when triggering workflows. During workflow trigger, Novu first checks if that context already exists. 

If not, Novu automatically creates it — but if it does exist, Novu reuses the existing record instead of updating it, to prevent accidental overwrites.

```tsx
import { novu } from './client';

await novu.trigger('payment-success', {
  to: {
    subscriberId: 'user-123',
  },
  payload: {
    amount: '$250',
    plan: 'Pro',
  },
  context: {
    tenant: {
      id: 'acme-corp',
      data: {
        name: 'Acme Corporation',
        plan: 'enterprise',
      },
    },
  },
});
```

In this example:
- The tenant context identifies the organization (“Acme Corporation”).
- Notifications triggered with this tenant context will be isolated to that tenant’s workspace.
- The same tenant ID must be passed to the Inbox to display these notifications.

### Filter the Inbox by tenant

Once your workflows are sending tenant-scoped notifications, you can filter the <Method href="/platform/inbox/configuration/inbox-with-context">{`<Inbox />`}</Method> so that each subscriber only sees notifications relevant to their tenant.

This is done by passing the same tenant context used in your workflow triggers to the <Method href="/platform/inbox/configuration/inbox-with-context">{`<Inbox />`}</Method>.

```tsx
import { Inbox } from '@novu/react';

<Inbox
  applicationIdentifier="APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER"
  subscriber="SUBSCRIBER_ID"
  context={{
    tenant: {
      id: 'acme-corp',
      data: {
        name: 'Acme Corporation',
        plan: 'enterprise',
      },
    },
  }}
/>

```

In this setup:

- The <Method href="/platform/inbox/configuration/inbox-with-context">{`<Inbox />`}</Method> filters notifications based on an exact context match. 
- Only notifications triggered with tenant: `{ id: 'acme-corp' }` will appear in the <Method href="/platform/inbox/configuration/inbox-with-context">{`<Inbox />`}</Method>.
- Notifications from other tenants are automatically excluded.

<Callout>If the tenant context doesn’t already exist in Novu, the Inbox will automatically find or create it. Learn more in [Inbox with Context](/platform/inbox/configuration/inbox-with-context).</Callout>

### Customize notification content based on tenant

With contexts, you can use tenant-level data to dynamically personalize notification content, branding, and workflow logic, all from a single workflow definition.

This eliminates the need to duplicate workflows or templates for each tenant while still keeping the experience distinct and relevant.

#### Using tenant data in templates

Once a tenant context is created, its data becomes accessible in all template editors (email, in-app, SMS, and push) through the `{{context}}` helper.

#### Dynamic logic per tenant

You can also use tenant context data to control conditional logic inside your workflows. For example, you may want to send certain updates only to enterprise tenants.
