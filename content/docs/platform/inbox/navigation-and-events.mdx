The Inbox component enables a rich context-aware in-app notifications center directly in your application, and with minimal effort.

Novu provides a pre-built, ready-to-use, and customizable Inbox UI component. It's in React today, and soon will be available in other popular frameworks including Vue, React Native, and full headless.
