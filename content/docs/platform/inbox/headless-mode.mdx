Build a fully custom notification inbox with the headless version of Novu's inbox notification package without being constrained by the default Inbox UI or dependencies.

This lightweight solution gives you full control over the UI and provides all the necessary API methods for fetching, managing, and receiving real-time notifications in your application.

## Getting started

Follow these steps to initialize the SDK and fetch notifications:

<Steps>
<Step>
    ### Install the SDK package

```package-install
npm i @novu/js
```

</Step>

  <Step>
    ### Initialize the SDK
    Initialize the Novu client with your application identifier and the current user's subscriber ID.

```javascript
import { Novu } from "@novu/js";

export const novu = new Novu({
  applicationIdentifier: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER',
  subscriber: 'YOUR_SUBSCRIBER_ID',
});
```

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Fetch notifications
    Use the `novu.notifications.list()` method to retrieve a paginated list of notifications for the subscriber.

    ```javascript
    const response = await novu.notifications.list({
      limit: 30,
    });

    const notifications = response.data.notifications;
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step>
   ### Display notifications
   Use your preferred framework or templating logic to render the notifications. For example, you can loop through the `notifications` array and display relevant fields:
   ```javascript
  notifications.forEach(notification => {
    console.log(`Notification ID: ${notification.id}`);
    console.log(`Title: ${notification.subject}`);
    console.log(`Content: ${notification.body}`);
  });
  ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Real-time notifications

Events are emitted when notifications are received, and when the unread notificatons count changes. `novu.on()` is used to listen to these events.

```tsx
novu.on("notifications.notification_received", (data) => {
  console.log("new notification =>", data);
});

novu.on("notifications.unread_count_changed", (data) => {
  console.log("new unread notifications count =>", data);
});
```

For the full list of methods available, see the [API Reference](/platform/sdks/javascript).

## Available methods

Here are a few commonly used notification, preferences and events methods youâ€™ll likely need when working headlessly:

| Action                          | Method Example                                                         |
| --------------------------------| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fetch notifications             | `novu.notifications.list()`                                            |
| Count notifications             | `novu.notifications.count()`                                           |
| Mark as read                    | `notification.read()` or `novu.notifications.read({ notificationId })` |
| Mark all as seen                | `novu.notifications.seenAll()`                                         |
| Archive notification            | `notification.archive()`                                               |
| Fetch subscriber's preferences  | `novu.preferences.list();`                                             |
| Real-time events	              | `novu.on('notifications.notification_received', handler)`

You can interact with individual notification instances or perform bulk actions through the `notifications` namespace.
