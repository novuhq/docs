The headless version of Novuâ€™s notification library package provides users with a lightweight solution for integrating notification functionality into their web applications. With just the essential API methods, users can easily incorporate our notification system into any framework or vanilla JavaScript project, without being constrained by our default UI or dependencies. The SDK includes real-time notifications through a WebSocket connection and can be safely used across web browsers.

<Steps>
<Step>
    ### Install the SDK

```package-install
npm i @novu/js
```

</Step>

  <Step>
    ### Initialize the SDK

```typescript
import { Novu } from "@novu/js";

export const novu = new Novu({
  applicationIdentifier: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER',
  subscriberId: 'YOUR_SUBSCRIBER_ID',
});
```

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Fetch notifications

```tsx
const response = await novu.notifications.list({
  limit: 30,
});

const notifications = response.data.notifications;
```

  </Step>

  <Step>
   Display notifications in your UI.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Realtime Notifications

Events are emitted when notifications are received, and when the unread notificatons count changes. `novu.on()` is used to listen to these events.

```tsx
novu.on("notifications.notification_received", (data) => {
  console.log("new notification =>", data);
});

novu.on("notifications.unread_count_changed", (data) => {
  console.log("new unread notifications count =>", data);
});
```

For the full list of methods available, see the [API Reference](/platform/sdks/javascript).
