Novu enables the creation of a multi-tab experience for the Inbox, allowing you to filter and display notification lists within distinct UI tabs.

## Defining tabs

Define the `tabs` prop to display multiple tabs in the Inbox component.

Each tab object should include a `label` and `filter` properties. The `label` property represents the text displayed on the specific tab. The `filter` property is an object that serves as the "filter criteria" for the notifications displayed in the list. The filter can include `tags` which is an array of strings, and optionally a `data` property for filtering by notification data attributes.

### Filtering by tags

The notifications are filtered and matched by comparing the [workflow](/platform/workflow/overview#tags) `tags` field with the tab `filter.tags` array. Each notification is a part of a specific [workflow](/platform/concepts/workflows). You can combine tags from different workflows to create a customized tab experience.

### Filtering by data attributes

You can also filter notifications based on their data attributes by using the `filter.data` property. This allows for more granular filtering based on the notification's payload data. The `data` property should be a JSON object with up to 2 levels of nesting, containing scalar values (string, number, boolean, or null). String values are limited to 256 characters.

The example below demonstrates how to define multiple tabs in the Inbox component using both tags and data filtering.

```tsx
import { Inbox } from '@novu/react';

const tabs = [
  {
    label: 'All Notifications',
    filter: { tags: [] },
  },
  {
    label: 'Newsletter',
    filter: { tags: ['newsletter'] },
  },
  {
    label: 'React',
    filter: { tags: ['react'] },
  },
  {
    label: 'High Priority',
    filter: { 
      tags: ['alert'], 
      data: { priority: 'high' } 
    },
  },
  {
    label: 'User Activity',
    filter: { 
      data: { 
        category: 'user', 
        details: { type: 'login' } 
      } 
    },
  },
];

function InboxNovu() {
  return (
    <Inbox
      applicationIdentifier="YOUR_APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER"
      subscriber="YOUR_SUBSCRIBER_ID"
      tabs={tabs}
    />
  );
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  Here tab `filter.tags` are taken from workflow tags. Tags can be configured in the
  [workflow](/platform/workflow/tags) editor.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  The `filter.data` property allows you to filter notifications based on their data attributes. 
  This is useful when you want to create tabs that filter notifications based on specific 
  properties in the notification payload rather than just workflow tags.
