Novu enables the creation of a multi-tab experience for the Inbox, allowing you to filter and display notification lists within distinct UI tabs.

## Defining tabs

Define the `tabs` prop to display multiple tabs in the Inbox component.

Each tab object should include a `label` and `filter` properties. The `label` property represents the text displayed on the specific tab. The `filter` property is an object that serves as the "filter criteria" for the notifications displayed in the list. The filter should include the `tags` which is an array of strings.

The notifications are filtered and matched by comparing the [workflow](/platform/workflow/overview#tags) `tags` field with the tab `filter.tags` array. Each notification is a part of a specific [workflow](/platform/concepts/workflows). You can combine tags from different workflows to create a customized tab experience.

The example below demonstrates how to define multiple tabs in the Inbox component.

```tsx
import { Inbox } from '@novu/react';

const tabs = [
  {
    label: 'All Notifications',
    filter: { tags: [] },
  },
  {
    label: 'Newsletter',
    filter: { tags: ['newsletter'] },
  },
  {
    label: 'React',
    filter: { tags: ['react'] },
  },
];

function InboxNovu() {
  return (
    <Inbox
      applicationIdentifier="YOUR_APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER"
      subscriber="YOUR_SUBSCRIBER_ID"
      tabs={tabs}
    />
  );
}
```

  Here tab `filter.tags` are taken from workflow tags. Tags can be configured in the
  [workflow](/platform/workflow/tags) editor.
