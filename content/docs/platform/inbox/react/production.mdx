This page explains how to prepare your React notification inbox for production deployment.

## HMAC encryption

When you add the Inbox to your application, you are required to pass a `subscriberId`, which identifies the user's end-customer, and the application Identifier, which is acted as a public key, to communicate with the notification feed API.

A malicious actor can access the user feed by accessing the API and passing another `subscriberId` using the public application identifier.

Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) encryption ensures that a `subscriberId` is encrypted using the secret API key, which helps prevent malicious actors from impersonating users.

## Set up HMAC encryption

To use HMAC encryption in Inbox for enhanced security, follow these steps:

### 1. Enable HMAC encryption in the In-App provider settings

1. Go to [Novu Dashboard](https://dashboard.novu.co).
2. Navigate to the [Integrations Store](https://dashboard.novu.co/integrations).
3. Click on the Novu In-App provider.
   
   A side panel will open from the right side of the screen with the provider settings.
4. Enable `Security HMAC encryption` toggle in **Integration Credentials** section.
5. Save the changes and copy the secret key from [API Keys](https://dashboard.novu.co/api-keys) page.

### 2. Generate HMAC hash on the server side

Use the `secret key` to generate an HMAC hash of the `subscriberId` on the server side. Keep `NOVU_SECRET_KEY` secure, and _never_ expose it to the client.

```tsx
import { createHmac } from 'crypto';

export const hmacHash = createHmac('sha256', process.env.NOVU_SECRET_KEY)
  .update(subscriberId)
  .digest('hex');
```

### 3. Use the HMAC hash in the Inbox component

Send the `hmacHash` generated in the previous step to the client side application via HTTP request or store it in the user's database record. Use it as the `subscriberHash` prop in the Inbox component. This example uses the `currentUser` hook to get the `hmacHash` from the user's database record.

```tsx
import { Inbox } from '@novu/react';

const { user } = currentUser();

const hmacHash = user?.novuSubscriberHash;

<Inbox
  applicationIdentifier="YOUR_APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER"
  subscriber="YOUR_SUBSCRIBER_ID"
  subscriberHash={hmacHash}
/>;
```

If HMAC encryption is active in In-App provider settings, and the `subscriberHash` and `subscriberId` are not provided, then Inbox will not load.
