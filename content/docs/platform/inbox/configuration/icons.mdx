You can customize or replace all the default icons in the Inbox UI with custom icons from your preferred library, such as [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) or [Material Icons](https://mui.com/material-ui/material-icons/), to match your visual style using the' icons' key in the `appearance` prop.

For each icon that you want to customize, provide a function that returns your custom icon as a React component.

```tsx
import { Inbox } from '@novu/react';
import { RiSettings3Fill, RiArrowDownLine, RiNotification3Fill} from 'react-icons/ri';

const appearance = {
    icons: {
      cogs: () => <RiSettings3Fill />,
      arrowDown: () => <RiArrowDownLine />,
      bell: () => <RiNotification3Fill />,
    },
  };

export function Novu() {
  return (
    <Inbox
      applicationIdentifier="YOUR_APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER"
      subscriber="YOUR_SUBSCRIBER_ID"
      appearance={appearance}
    />
  );
}
```

<Callout type="info">
You can inspect the Inbox component using your browser‚Äôs developer tools to discover icon keys. Icon elements have class names that start with `nv-` and include a üñºÔ∏è emoji for easier identification. The part following `nv-` is the icon key. For example, an element with the class `nv-cogs` has the icon key `cogs`.
