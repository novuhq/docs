import { Tab, Tabs } from "fumadocs-ui/components/tabs";

The `useCounts` hook provides a way to fetch various notification counts, including unread, unseen, and total counts. This hook is useful for displaying notification badges and indicators in your application.

## Hook Parameters

<TypeTable
  type={{
    filters: {
      type: "NotificationFilter[]",
      description: "Array of filters to apply when fetching counts",
      typeDescription: "Required",
      required: true,
    },
    onSuccess: {
      type: "(data: Count[]) => void",
      description:
        "Callback function called when counts are successfully fetched",
    },
    onError: {
      type: "(error: NovuError) => void",
      description: "Callback function called when an error occurs",
    },
  }}
/>

## Return Value

```typescript
type Count = {
  count: number;
  filter: NotificationFilter;
};

type UseCountsResult = {
  counts?: Count[];
  error?: NovuError;
  isLoading: boolean;
  isFetching: boolean;
  refetch: () => Promise<void>;
};
```

## Example Usage

Here's how to use the `useCounts` hook to fetch and display notification counts:

```tsx
import { useCounts } from "@novu/react";

function BellButton() {
  const { counts } = useCounts({ 
    filters: [
      { read: false }, // Unread notifications
      { seen: false }  // Unseen notifications
    ] 
  });
  
  const unreadCount = counts?.[0]?.count ?? 0;
  const unseenCount = counts?.[1]?.count ?? 0;

  return (
    <button>
      <BellIcon />
      {unseenCount > 0 && <span className="badge">{unseenCount}</span>}
    </button>
  );
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  The counts are automatically updated in real-time when notifications are
  marked as read/unread or when new notifications arrive.
</Callout>
