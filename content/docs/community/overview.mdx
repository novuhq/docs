Welcome to the Novu community! As the leading open-source notification infrastructure, Novu enables developers and product teams to manage notifications across multiple channels seamlessly. Whether you're building in-app notifications, email alerts, or SMS updates, Novu provides the tools to simplify integration and enhance your communication strategy.

Our mission is to create a platform where every developer can easily implement notifications, with a strong, growing community to support you in every step.

## Community details

The Novu community is built on collaboration. Whether you're contributing code, helping with documentation, or supporting others in Discord, we welcome everyone. We have dedicated teams across various areas:

- **Developers:** Working on the core project and building new features.
- **Contributors:** Writing documentation, reporting bugs, and suggesting improvements.
- **Maintainers:** Ensuring the health of the project by reviewing and merging contributions.
- **Ambassadors**: The most involved contributors and community members nominated by the Community and approved by Novu.

You can find our official community communication channels on Discord. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, there's a place for you here.

## Novu Cloud, or Novu Project?

The Novu Project is our fully open source, community backed project. It is a complete notifications infrastructure platform that offers all the core components you need to implement notifications.

Novu Cloud is our commercial service offering. It is a superset of the Novu Project that includes additional features and capabilities businesses require to succeed with notifications at scale.

## Using Novu

There are two ways to get started with Novu.

### 1. Create a free account in our hosted Novu Cloud service

**Who it's for:** Most businesses, smaller organizations and teams, businesses that do not want to architect and host their own infrastructure, and businesses that do not want to worry about upgrades and system maintenance.

**Who it's not for:** Organizations that want to self-host their own instance of Novu, or plan on making customizations to their Novu installation.

### 2. Self-host

Self-hosting Novu is a great way to rapidly test new custom providers, or to test your contributions.

**Use the Community Docker instances**

- **Who it's for:** Individuals and organizations that want to experiment with more advanced notifications infrastructure architectures, businesses that have a strict requirement to run notifications on premises or inside their own network boundary.
- **Who it's not for:** Non-technical users or teams that are not familiar with implementation and management of container infrastructure. Organizations that require rapid scale-up out-of-the-box, and that don't have the skills and knowledge required to implement and adjust deployments.

**Build it yourself**

- **Who it's for:** Highly technical users that are deeply familiar with the required infrastructure components and technologies required to run it either locally or in your own cloud. Developers that want to experiment. Builders that are actively contributing to the Novu Project, and are testing new functionality.
- **Who it's not for:** Nearly everyone else. ;)
