# Migrating from Novu Self-Hosted v0 to v2

This guide will help you migrate your existing Novu self-hosted v0 instance to v2. Due to significant architectural changes between versions, some manual steps are required, particularly for workflow migration.

## Prerequisites

- Access to your existing v0 instance
- New v2 instance ready for deployment
- Temporary ability to run both instances simultaneously for migration purposes

## API Changes in v2

The v2 API introduces several new endpoints and improvements. Here are the key changes:

### New v2 Routes

1. **Subscribers** (`/v2/subscribers`)
   - Enhanced subscriber management with new endpoints:
     - `GET /` - Search subscribers with advanced filtering
     - `GET /:subscriberId` - Retrieve specific subscriber
     - `POST /` - Create new subscriber
     - `PATCH /:subscriberId` - Update subscriber details
     - `DELETE /:subscriberId` - Remove subscriber
   - New preferences management:
     - `GET /:subscriberId/preferences` - Get subscriber preferences
     - `PATCH /:subscriberId/preferences` - Update preferences

## Migrating Workflows

The most important part of migration is preserving your notification workflows. Here's how to transfer them:

1. **Run both instances temporarily**: Deploy v2 alongside your v0 installation
2. **Access both dashboards**: Open the admin dashboards for both versions
3. **Copy workflow configurations**: For each workflow in v0:
   - Note all steps, templates, and trigger configurations
   - Manually recreate them in v2 with the same structure
   - Verify variables, conditions, and integrations are properly configured

### Workflow Migration Checklist

For each workflow, ensure you migrate:

- ✓ Workflow name and identifier
- ✓ Step configurations (email, SMS, push, etc.)
- ✓ Content templates with variables
- ✓ Delivery conditions
