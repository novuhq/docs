## Better together

Self-Hosted is where the community comes together with our development teams to improve notifications for everyone. Novu Cloud is our commercial offering, and where we extend the capabilities of the Self-Hosted and make them accessible and consumable by all teams and businesses. Most simply, the Self-Hosted is how you test and experiment with notifications infrastructure, and Novu Cloud is how you press the easy button for all things notifications.

### Key differences

Our goal is always provide a functional, powerful, and complete notifications infrastructure platform, whether you opt to self host or use our cloud offering. However, certain features we build into Novu Cloud are not available in the Self-Hosted. When this happens, it's for several reasons:

- We rely on a paid third-party service provider
- The feature is complex and requires significant investment (read: money!) time to build and maintain
- The feature is primarily targeted at the largest and most sophisticated of use cases, and supporting these in self-hosted environments is challenging

### Current matrix

Below you will find a table that outlines the best available Novu Cloud Tier, compared to the available Self-Hosted capabilities.

### Unmatched flexbility

One huge advantage of working with Novu? If you opt for a paid Novu Cloud account, you can always fall back to the free tier, or migrate your notifications to a self-hosted Self-Hosted instance. Say goodbye to notifications risk.

### Enterprise Self-Hosted: The Best of Both Worlds
 
For organizations with specific security, compliance, or infrastructure requirements, we offer an Enterprise Self-Hosted plan that combines the flexibility of self-hosting with the full feature set of Novu Cloud. This option is ideal for:

- Financial institutions requiring strict data sovereignty
- Healthcare organizations with HIPAA compliance needs
- Government agencies with specific security requirements
- Enterprises with existing infrastructure investments
- Organizations requiring custom security reviews and compliance certifications

The Enterprise Self-Hosted plan includes all Novu Cloud features, plus:
- Dedicated support and implementation assistance
- Custom security reviews and compliance documentation
- Flexible deployment options (on-premises or private cloud)
- Custom integration support
- Extended retention periods
- Priority feature requests
- Custom SLAs and support levels

### Already Self-Hosting? Consider Your Options

If you're currently self-hosting Novu, you have two powerful paths forward:

1. **Upgrade to Novu Cloud**
   - Eliminate infrastructure management overhead
   - Access enterprise features immediately
   - Benefit from automatic updates and improvements
   - Scale without infrastructure concerns
   - Perfect for teams wanting to focus on their core product

2. **Switch to Enterprise Self-Hosted**
   - Maintain control over your infrastructure
   - Access all enterprise features
   - Meet strict compliance requirements
   - Customize security and deployment
   - Ideal for organizations with specific regulatory needs

Both options provide seamless migration paths from your current self-hosted setup, with our team assisting every step of the way.
