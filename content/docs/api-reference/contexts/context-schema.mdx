### Context

**Context** is a reusable, user-defined data object that stores metadata (like tenant, region, or app details) to organize and personalize notifications. Unlike payloads that exist only for a single workflow execution, contexts are persistent and can be shared across multiple workflows and API calls. 
This makes them particularly useful for multi-tenant applications, dynamic branding, and scenarios where notifications need to reference common, reusable data.
