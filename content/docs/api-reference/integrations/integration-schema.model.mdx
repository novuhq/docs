### Integration

Integration is third party service used by Novu to send notification for a specific channel. For example, [sengrid](/platform/integrations/email/sendgrid) is a email integration and [twilio](/platform/integrations/sms/twilio) is a sms integration. Read more about integrations on [integrations concept page](/platform/concepts/integrations).

### Credentials

Each integration has a set of credentials that are used to authenticate with the third party service. Checkout the provider documentation for more details on what credentials are required for each integration.

### ChannelTypeEnum

ChannelTypeEnum is used to specify the type of channel that the integration is used for. For example, if the integration is used for email, the channel type will be `email`.

```typescript
ChannelTypeEnum {
  IN_APP = "in_app",
  EMAIL = "email",
  SMS = "sms",
  CHAT = "chat",
  PUSH = "push"
}
```
