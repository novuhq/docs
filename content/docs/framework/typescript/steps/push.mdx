The `push` step allows you to send notifications to mobile and web applications through various push notification providers.

## Example Usage

```tsx
await step.push('new-message', async () => {
  return {
    title: 'New Message',
    body: 'You have received a new message from John',
    data: {
      messageId: '123',
      senderId: '456',
    },
  };
});
```
