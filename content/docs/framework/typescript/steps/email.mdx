The `email` step allows you to send email notifications to your users. This step supports HTML content and can be used with React Email for building beautiful email templates.

## Example Usage

```tsx
await step.email('welcome-email', async () => {
  return {
    subject: 'Welcome to Our Platform',
    body: "Hello and welcome! We're excited to have you on board.",
  };
});
```
