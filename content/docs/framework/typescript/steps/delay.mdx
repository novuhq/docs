import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

The `delay` step allows you to pause the execution of your workflow for a specified duration. This is useful for implementing features like follow-up notifications, reminder sequences, or cooldown periods.

## Example Usage

```tsx
// Wait for 24 hours
await step.delay('reminder-delay', async () => {
    return {
        amount: 24,
        unit: 'hours'
    };
});

// Send a follow-up email
await step.email('follow-up', async () => {
    return {
        subject: 'How are you liking our product?',
        body: 'We noticed you signed up yesterday. How has your experience been so far?'
    };
});
```

## Delay Step Output

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
| -------- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| amount | number | Yes | The number of time units to delay |
| unit | 'seconds' \| 'minutes' \| 'hours' \| 'days' \| 'weeks' \| 'months' | Yes | The time unit for the delay duration |

## Delay Step Result

| Property | Type | Description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| duration | number | The total delay duration in milliseconds |

<Callout type="info">
The delay step can be skipped conditionally using the `skip` option, allowing you to implement dynamic delay logic based on your workflow's needs.
</Callout>

## Conditional Delay Example

```tsx
await step.delay('premium-user-delay', 
    async () => {
        return {
            amount: 24,
            unit: 'hours'
        };
    },
    {
        // Skip the delay for premium users
        skip: async () => user.isPremium
    }
);
