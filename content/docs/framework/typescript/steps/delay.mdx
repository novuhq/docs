---

The `delay` step allows you to pause the execution of your workflow for a specified duration. This is useful for implementing features like follow-up notifications, reminder sequences, or cooldown periods.

## Example Usage

```tsx
// Wait for 24 hours
await step.delay('reminder-delay', async () => {
  return {
    amount: 24,
    unit: 'hours',
  };
});

// Send a follow-up email
await step.email('follow-up', async () => {
  return {
    subject: 'How are you liking our product?',
    body: 'We noticed you signed up yesterday. How has your experience been so far?',
  };
});
```

## Delay Step Output

| Property | Type                                                               | Required | Description                          |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| amount   | number                                                             | Yes      | The number of time units to delay    |
| unit     | 'seconds' \| 'minutes' \| 'hours' \| 'days' \| 'weeks' \| 'months' | Yes      | The time unit for the delay duration |

## Delay Step Result

| Property | Type   | Description                              |
| -------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| duration | number | The total delay duration in milliseconds |

<Callout type="info">
  The delay step can be skipped conditionally using the `skip` option, allowing you to implement
  dynamic delay logic based on your workflow's needs.
</Callout>

## Conditional Delay Example

```tsx
await step.delay(
  'premium-user-delay',
  async () => {
    return {
      amount: 24,
      unit: 'hours',
    };
  },
  {
    // Skip the delay for premium users
    skip: async () => user.isPremium,
  }
);
```
