---

The `digest` step allows you to collect multiple events over a specified time period and combine them into a single notification. This is useful for reducing notification fatigue and providing better context to your users.

## Example Usage

```tsx
const { events } = await step.digest('daily-summary', async () => {
  return {
    amount: 1,
    unit: 'days',
  };
});

await step.email('digest-email', async () => {
  return {
    subject: `Daily Summary (${events.length} updates)`,
    body: `You have ${events.length} new updates today`,
  };
});
```

## Digest Step Output

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| amount | number | Yes | The number of time units to collect events for |
| unit | 'seconds' \| 'minutes' \| 'hours' \| 'days' \| 'weeks' \| 'months' | Yes | The time unit for the digest period |
| cron | string | No | The cron expression to use for the digest |
| digestKey | string | No | The key to use for digesting events |

<Callout type="info">
  Use either cron or amount-unit. Using both will result in an error.
</Callout>

## Digest Step Result

| Property | Type          | Description                                        |
| -------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| events   | DigestEvent[] | Array of events collected during the digest period |

## DigestEvent Type

| Property | Type   | Description                                 |
| -------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| id       | string | The unique identifier of the digested event |
| time     | Date   | The timestamp when the event was triggered  |
| payload  | object | The original payload passed to the event    |

<Callout type="info">
  The digest step result can only be used in subsequent steps within the same workflow. You cannot
  access digest information in step controls.
</Callout>

## Using Digest Events

You can use the digested events to create rich, aggregated notifications. Here's an example:

```tsx
import { ActivityDigestEmail } from './ActivityDigestEmail';

const { events } = await step.digest('activity-digest', async () => {
  return {
    amount: 1,
    unit: 'hours',
  };
});

await step.email('digest-notification', async () => {
  const activities = events.map((event) => ({
    type: event.payload.type,
    user: event.payload.userName,
    action: event.payload.action,
  }));

  return {
    subject: `Activity Summary (${events.length} updates)`,
    body: render(<ActivityDigestEmail activities={activities} />),
  };
});
```

## Cron based digest

You can use cron based digest to digest events based on a cron expression.

```tsx
const digestedEvents = await step.digest('cron-digest', async () => {
  return {
    cron: '0 0 * * *', // every day at midnight
  };
});
```

## Custom Digest Key

You can use a custom digest key to digest events based on a custom key. By default, events are digested based on the `subscriberId`. With a custom digest key, events are digested based on the combination of the `subscriberId` and the `digestKey` value.

```tsx
export const customDigestKey = workflow(
  "custom-digest-key",
  async ({ step, payload }) => {
    const { events } = await step.digest("digest-step", async () => {
      return {
        unit: "hours",
        amount: 1,
        digestKey: payload.ticket_id,
      };
    });

    console.log("events ==>", events);

    // use above events to send email / in-app notification
  },
  {
    payloadSchema: z.object({
      ticket_id: z.string(),
    }),
  }
);
```

<Callout type="warn">
  Changes to the workflow content after triggering will not affect existing digested events. The
  content is determined at the time of event digestion.
</Callout>
