Novu Framework enables you to run a part of the core Novu workflow engine from within your network boundary. This also opens up a powerful new capability: **you can create Novu workflows entirely in code**. This is important because:

- You can inject custom code that does nearly anything you can imagine as part of a Novu workflow
- Your code-based workflow lives alongside your application code in source control
- You can hydrate notification content using local data-sources, reducing what you need to sync outside of your IT boundary

### What it is and how it works

Novu Framework is an application and SDK that you run locally, and communicates natively with the Novu Cloud Worker Engine via the Novu API.

Novu Framework requires a single HTTP webhook-like endpoint (/api/novu or similar) to be exposed by your application. This endpoint is called a **Bridge Endpoint** and is used to receive events from our Worker Engine through an encrypted client-initiated tunnel.

When enabled, Novu Cloud will call the Bridge Endpoint when it needs to retrieve contextual information for a given subscriber and notification.

Use the `npx novu init` command to create a sample Bridge application with a built-in Bridge Endpoint.
