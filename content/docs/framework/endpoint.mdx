title: 'Bridge Endpoint'

import { Accordion, Accordions } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/accordion';

Novu Framework requires a **single** `HTTP` endpoint (`/api/novu` or similar) to be exposed by your application. This endpoint is used to receive events from our **Worker Engine**.

You can view the Bridge Endpoint as a webhook endpoint that Novu will call when it needs to retrieve contextual information for a given subscriber and notification.

Using the `npx novu init` command creates a Bridge application for you with a Bridge Endpoint ready to go.

## The `serve` function

We offer framework specific wrappers in form of an exported `serve` function that abstracts away:

- Parsing the incoming request for `GET`, `POST`, `PUT` and `OPTIONS` requests
- HMAC header authentication
- Framework specific response and error handling

Currently, we offer `serve` functions for the following frameworks:

- [Next.js](/framework/quickstart/nextjs)
- [Express.js](/framework/quickstart/express)
- [Nuxt](/framework/quickstart/nuxt)
- [h3](/framework/quickstart/h3)
- [Remix](/framework/quickstart/remix)
- [Sveltekit](/framework/quickstart/svelte)

## Writing a custom `serve` function

If we currently don't support your framework, you can write a custom `serve` function like the following example:

```ts
import { type Request, type Response } from 'express';
import { NovuRequestHandler, ServeHandlerOptions } from '@novu/framework';

export const serve = (options: ServeHandlerOptions) => {
  const requestHandler = new NovuRequestHandler({
    frameworkName: 'express',
    ...options,
    handler: (incomingRequest: Request, response: Response) => ({
      method: () => incomingRequest.method,
      headers: (key) => {
        const header = incomingRequest.headers[key];
        return Array.isArray(header) ? header[0] : header;
      },
      queryString: (key) => {
        const qs = incomingRequest.query[key];
        return Array.isArray(qs) ? qs[0] : qs;
      },
      body: () => incomingRequest.body,
      url: () =>
        new URL(incomingRequest.url, `https://${incomingRequest.headers.get('host') || ''}`),
      transformResponse: ({ body, headers, status }) => {
        Object.entries(headers).forEach(([headerName, headerValue]) => {
          response.setHeader(headerName, headerValue);
        });

        return response.status(status).send(body);
      },
    }),
  });

  return requestHandler.createHandler();
};
```

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="What is the difference between tunnel url and bridge url?">
    The tunnel url is the url that is generated by the Studio when you run the `npx novu@latest dev` command. It is used to test your notifications by triggering them from the Studio UI. For local development and testing, you can use the tunnel url as bridge url. For production, you should use deployed application url with bridge endpoint as the bridge url.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is it necessary to have bridge url publicly accessible?">
    Yes, the bridge url must be publicly accessible. We recommend having https enabled for the bridge url.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can endpoint other than /api/novu be used?">
    Yes, you can use any path you want. However, you need to make sure that the endpoint is used in the bridge url. Bridge url is made of the base url and the endpoint path. If your path is /custom-path/novu and deployed application url is https://my-app.com, then the bridge url will be https://my-app.com/custom-path/novu.
