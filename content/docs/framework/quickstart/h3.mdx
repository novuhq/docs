In this guide, we will add a Novu [Bridge Endpoint](/concepts/endpoint) to a H3 application and send our first test workflow.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Set up your local environment">
        <LocalStudio />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Install packages">
        <PackagesStep />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add a Novu API Endpoint">
        ```typescript app/server/api/novu.ts
        import { createApp, eventHandler, toNodeListener } from "h3";
        import { serve } from "@novu/framework/h3";
        import { createServer } from "node:http";
        import { testWorkflow } from "./novu/workflows";

        const app = createApp();

        app.use("/api/novu", eventHandler(serve({ workflows: [testWorkflow] }) ));

        createServer(toNodeListener(app)).listen(4000);
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Configure your secret key">
        <SecretStep />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create your workflow definition">
        Add a `novu` folder in your app folder as such ```novu/workflows.ts``` that will contain your workflow definitions.

        <WorkflowStep />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Start your application">
        Start your H3 server with the Novu Endpoint configured.

        If your H3 application is running on other than `4000` port, restart the `npx novu dev` command with the port:

        ```tsx
        npx novu@latest dev --port <YOUR_H3_APPLICATION_PORT>
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Test your endpoint">
        <TestStep framework="H3" />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Deploy your application">
        <DeployApp />
    </Step>
</Steps>
