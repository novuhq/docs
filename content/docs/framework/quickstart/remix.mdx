In this guide, we will add a Novu [Bridge Endpoint](/docs/concepts/endpoint) to a Remix application and send our first test workflow.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Set up your local environment">
        <LocalStudio />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Install packages">
        <PackagesStep />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add a Novu API Endpoint">
        This guide is based on Remix Offical [Quick Start](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/start/quickstart).

        ```typescript app/routes/api.novu.ts
        import { serve } from "@novu/framework/remix";
        import { testWorkflow } from "../novu/workflows";
        
        const handler = serve({
            workflows: [testWorkflow]
        });
        
        export { handler as action, handler as loader };
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Configure your secret key">
        <SecretStep />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create your workflow definition">
        Add a `novu` folder in your app folder as such ```app/novu/workflows.ts``` that will contain your workflow definitions. 

        <WorkflowStep />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Start your application">
        To start your Remix server with the Novu Endpoint configured, run the following command:

        ```bash
        cd my-novu-app && npm run dev
        ```

        Remix application default port is 5173. For that to work, restart Novu Studio and point it to the right port:

        ```bash
        npx novu@latest dev --port <YOUR_REMIX_APPLICATION_PORT>
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Test your endpoint">
        <TestStep framework="Remix" />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Deploy your application">
        <DeployApp />
    </Step>
</Steps>
