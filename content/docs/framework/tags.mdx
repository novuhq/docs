**Tags** act like labels or categories that help you organize and manage notifications in your app. By grouping notifications under specific tags, you can better control how they're filtered, displayed, or managed by both your app and your users.

## How to Add Tags to Notifications

Adding tags to a notification is simple and can be done directly in the workflow configuration.
Here's an example:

```tsx
import { workflow } from '@novu/framework';

workflow(
  'acme-login-alert',
  async ({ step, payload }) => {
    await step.inApp('inbox', async () => {
      return {
        subject: 'New Login Detected',
        body: "We noticed a login from a new device or location. If this wasn't you, change your password immediately.",
      };
    });
  },
  {
    tags: ['security'],
  }
);

workflow(
  'acme-password-change',
  async ({ step, payload }) => {
    await step.inApp('inbox', async () => {
      return {
        subject: 'Password Changed',
        body: "Your password was successfully updated. If you didn't request this, contact support right away.",
      };
    });
  },
  {
    tags: ['security'],
  }
);
```

Let's break it down:
In the above workflows, whenever someone logs in from a new device, or changes their password, the notification is tagged as security.

**Benefits:**

- **Filtered Views**: Users can quickly locate security-related notifications in their inbox.
- **Custom Preferences**: Users who only want security alerts can opt in or out of that tag category.
