The Email Channel is a critical component for delivering notifications reliably. Whether it's a password reset, an onboarding email, or an alert about account activity, email remains a trusted medium for reaching users.
Novu simplifies this process, allowing you to focus on implementation rather than infrastructure.

```tsx
await step.email('email', async () => {
  return {
    subject: 'You received a message',
    body: 'A new post has been created',
  };
});
```
