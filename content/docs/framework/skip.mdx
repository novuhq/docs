The `skip` action is used to skip the next step in the workflow. `skip` function is available for all the steps in the workflow.

## Common usecases

- Skip the step if the user has already seen the notification
- Skip the step if the user has not completed the previous step

## Example

In this example, we will send an in-app notification for task reminder to the user and then send an email reminder 6 hours later if the user has not read the in-app notification.

```tsx
workflow('skip-email-if-in-app-notification-seen', async ({ payload }) => {
  const inAppNotification = await step.inApp(
    'send-in-app-notification',
    async () => {
      return {
        subject: 'Task reminder!',
        body: 'Task is not yet complete. Please complete the task.',
      };
    },
  );

  // delay for 6 hrs
  await step.delay("delay-step-before-email", async () => {
    return {
      unit: 'hours',
      amount: 6,
    };
  });

  // send email notification after 6 hrs if the in-app notification has not been read
  await step.email(
    'send-email',
    () => {
      return {
        subject: `Task reminder!`,
        body: 'Task is not yet complete. Please complete the task.',
      };
    },
    {
      // skip the email step if the in-app notification has been read
      skip: () => inAppNotification.read === true,
    }
  );
});
```
