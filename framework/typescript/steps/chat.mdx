The `chat` step allows you to send a message to a chat channel. This is useful when you need to send a message to a chat channel, such as Slack, Discord, or Microsoft Teams.

### Chat Credentials

In order to send a chat message, you need to set the specific chat provider credentials for the subscriber. 
You can learn more about how to achieve this for each provider in the [Provider Documentation](/integrations/providers/chat/overview).

## Chat Output

    });
    ```
</RequestExample>

<ParamField path="body" type="string" required>

## Chat Result

The `chat` step does not return any result object.
