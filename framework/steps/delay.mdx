Use the delay action whenever you need to pause the execution of your workflow for a period of time.

```tsx
await step.delay('delay-1-week', async () => {
  return {
	  unit: 'weeks', // 'seconds' | 'minutes' | 'hours' | 'days' | 'weeks' | 'months'
	  amount: 1, // the number of units to delay workflow execution for
	};
});
```
