The Echo CLI provides a mechanism for you to synchronize your Workflows into Novu Cloud so that non-technical Novu Users can control the Workflow and Step-level inputs and enable your Workflows to be triggered via Novu API.

```bash
npx novu-labs@latest sync --echo-url <YOUR URL> --api-key <NOVU_API_KEY>
```
