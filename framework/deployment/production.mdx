## Networking

Novu Cloud workers will need to be able to communicate with your [Bridge Endpoint](/concepts/endpoint). You will need to ensure that your firewall rules allow traffic from the internet.
Due to the autoscaling nature of Novu Cloud, we don't have a set of IP Addresses that you can whitelist.

## Security

Novu Cloud workers are GDPR, SOC2 type II and ISO 27001 compliant. We take security very seriously and have implemented a number of security measures to ensure that your data is safe.
Novu Framework has a builtin security mechanism that ensures that the requests are authentic from Novu Cloud using an HMAC signature.

HMAC Verification is turned on by default for all "production" NODE_ENV environments

<Info>
  For `NODE_ENV=development` the HMAC validation is turned off, for the Studio to be able to reach your endpoint.
</Info>

The `Novu-Signature` header included in each signed event contains a timestamp and one or more signatures that we verify.
The timestamp is prefixed by `t=`, and each signature is prefixed by a scheme.
Schemes start with `v`, followed by an integer. Currently, the only valid live signature scheme is v1.

{/* todo add an example of the x-novu-signature header here */}

Handling the signature verification is done by the Novu Framework, so you don't need to perform any action.
