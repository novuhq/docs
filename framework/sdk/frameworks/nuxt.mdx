Novu Framework works out of the box with Nuxt.js. You can use the `@novu/framework/nuxt` package to serve your Bridge endpoint in your Nuxt.js application.

For a boilerplate project with Vue Email, view: [Nuxt.js Boilerplate](https://github.com/novuhq/echo-nuxt-example/)

import { serve } from "@novu/framework/nuxt";
import { myWorkflow } from "../workflows";

export default defineEventHandler(serve({ workflows: [myWorkflow] }));
```
