See the snippet below to learn how to configure your Bridge endpoint application.

```tsx
import { Client } from '@novu/framework';

const client = new Client({
  /**
   * Specify a custom Novu API URL.
   * Defaults to 'https://api.novu.co', for EU use: https://eu.api.novu.co
   */
	apiUrl: 'https://api.novu.co',
  /**
   * Specify your Novu API key, to secure your Bridge API endpoint.
   * Novu communicates securely with your endpoint using a signed HMAC header,
   * ensuring that only trusted requests from Novu are actioned by your Bridge API.
   * The API key is used to sign the HMAC header.
   */
	apiKey: process.env.NOVU_API_KEY,
  /**
   * Explicitly use HMAC signature verification.
   * Setting this to `false` will enable Novu to communicate with your Bridge API
   * without requiring a valid HMAC signature.
   * This is useful for local development and testing.
   *
   * You are strongly encouraged to specify an `apiKey` and set this to `true` in production,
   * to ensure that only trusted requests from Novu are actioned by your Bridge API.
   *
   * Defaults to true.
   */
	strictAuthentication: process.env.NODE_ENV !== "development",
});
