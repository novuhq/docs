The Email Channel is a critical component for delivering notifications reliably. Whether itâ€™s a password reset, an onboarding email, or an alert about account activity, email remains a trusted medium for reaching users. 
Novu simplifies this process, allowing you to focus on implementation rather than infrastructure.

```typescript
await step.email('email', async () => {
    return {
        subject: 'You received a message',
        body: 'A new post has been created',
    };
});
```
