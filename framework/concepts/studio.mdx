The Echo Dev Studio is a companion app to the Echo Client SDK. Its goal is to provide a local environment that lives near your code.

To launch the dev studio locally you can run: `npx novu-labs@latest echo` . The Dev Studio will be started by default on port 2022, and accessible via: `http://localhost:2022`

After successfully connecting the Studio to your local edge endpoint, you will be able to preview in real time any workflows and content defined in your code. This is ideal for quick prototyping, debugging, styling, and adjusting your workflows before syncing them to Novu Cloud.

### Inputs and Payload forms

You can quickly modify the step inputs and workflow payload to preview your workflow's different states and be generated with. This is helpful to quickly debug how the email will behave in case of a missing input, or iterate more complex content structures.

### Syncing State

Sync state to your Production or Development environment in Novu, is recommended to do via your CI pipeline. However, a sync can be made using the Dev Studio for quick experimentation.

Click on the `Sync` button at the top right corner of the navigation bar, and a Diff will be generated between your local and the Novu Cloud environments.

After inspecting the State Diff, and specifying the remote `Echo Url` Click on the `Deploy Changes` button.

### **Debugging locally**

To allow Novu to communicate with your local machine a tunnel will need to be generated. The quickest way to do it is with `localtunnel.` To Create a new tunnel in your terminal, type: `npx localtunnel --port <YOUR_EDGE_PORT>` . This command will return an https endpoint, which then can be used during the sync state flow described earlier.
