Inputs are defined using [JSON Schema](/framework/recipes/json-schema), providing a strong run-time validation system for your workflows.

This ensures that you as the developer, and your non-technical peers are speaking the same language.
Those responsible for styling and copy can edit with confidence, knowing their changes are tested in code.

## Inputs vs Payload

**Inputs** - For Non-Technical Peers and Developers. Managed in the Novu Web UI, defined by developers and used by non-technical peers.
<Info>
  **Examples** - Color of a button, text of a button, should a section be shown, digest duration, static text content, the order of the email sections, and etc...
</Info>

**Payload Schema** - For Developers. Passed during the `novu.trigger` method, and controlled by the developer.
<Info>
  **Examples** - User ID, Post ID, Comment, Order ID, 2FA token and etc...
</Info>

## Step Inputs

[Step](/framework/concepts/steps) input schema is defining the input passed during the `step` method. Those inputs can be modified and persisted in the Novu Web UI.

The snippet below shows configuration for the Workflow payload schema and the Step input schema. If you donâ€™t provide a schema, Typescript will infer the data type to `unknown`, reminding you of the best practice to specify your schema.

```tsx
workflow('new-signup', async ({ step, payload }) => {
    await step.email(
      'send-email',
      async (inputs) => {
          return {
            subject: inputs.subjectTitle,
            body: render(<ReactEmailContent hideBanner={inputs.hideBanner} components={inputs.components} />),
        }
      }, {
	      // Learn about JSON Schema here: https://json-schema.org/specification
        inputSchema: {
	        // Always `object`
          type: 'object',
          // Specify the properties to validate. Supports deep nesting.
          properties: {
            hideBanner: { type: 'boolean', default: false },
            subjectTitle: { type: 'string' },
            // Allowing no code control over the component in the Web UI
            components: {
                type: "array",
                items: {
                    type: "string"
                },
                default: ["header", "cta-row", "footer"]
            }
          },
          // Specify the array of which properties are required.
          required: ['complianceFooter'],
          // Used to enforce full type strictness, with no rogue properties.
          additionalProperties: false,
		      // The `as const` is important to let Typescript know that this
		      // type won't change, enabling strong typing on `inputs` via type
		      // inference of the provided JSON Schema.
        } as const,
      });
});
