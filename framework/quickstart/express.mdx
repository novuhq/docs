In this guide, we will add a Novu [Bridge Endpoint](/concepts/endpoint) to a Express.js application and send our first test workflow.

<Steps>
    <LocalStudio />
    <PackagesStep />
    <Step title="Add a Novu API Endpoint">
        <CodeGroup>

            ```typescript app/server/api/novu.ts
            import { serve } from "@novu/framework/express";
            import { testWorkflow } from "../novu/workflows";

            app.use(express.json()); // Required for Novu POST requests
            app.use( "/api/novu", serve({ workflows: [testWorkflow] }) );
            ```
        </CodeGroup>
    </Step>
    <SecretStep />

    <Step title="Create your workflow definition">
        Add a `novu` folder in your app folder as such ```novu/workflows.ts``` that will contain your workflow definitions.

        <WorkflowStep />
    </Step>

    <Step title="Start your application">
        Start your Express server with the Novu Endpoint configured.

        If your Express application is running on other than `4000` port, restart the `npx novu dev` command with the port:

        ```tsx
        npx novu@latest dev --port <YOUR_EXPRESS_JS_APPLICATION_PORT>
        ```
    </Step>
    <TestStep framework="Express.js" />
    <DeployApp />

</Steps>
