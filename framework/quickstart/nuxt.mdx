In this guide, we will add a Novu [Bridge Endpoint](/concepts/endpoint) to a Nuxt application and send our first test workflow.

<Steps>
    <LocalStudio />
    <PackagesStep />
    <Step title="Add a Novu API Endpoint">
        <CodeGroup>
            ```typescript app/server/api/novu.ts
            import { serve } from '@novu/framework/nuxt';
            import { testWorkflow } from "../novu/workflows";

            export default defineEventHandler(serve({ workflows: [myWorkflow] }));
            ```
        </CodeGroup>
    </Step>
    <SecretStep />

    <Step title="Create your workflow definition">
        Add a `novu` folder in your app folder as such ```app/server/api/novu.ts``` that will contain your workflow definitions.

        <WorkflowStep />
    </Step>

    <Step title="Start your application">
        Start your Nuxt application with the Novu Endpoint configured.

        ```bash
        cd my-novu-app && npm run dev
        ```

        If your Nuxt application is running on other than `4000` port, restart the `npx novu dev` command with the port:

        ```bash
        npx novu@latest dev --port <YOUR_NUXT_APPLICATION_PORT>
        ```
    </Step>
    <TestStep framework="Nuxt" />
    <DeployApp />

</Steps>
