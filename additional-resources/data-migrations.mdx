On occasion, Novu may introduce features that require changes to the database schema or data.
This usually happens when a feature has a hard dependency on some data being available on a database entity.
You can use migrations to make these changes to your database.

## Running Migrations

To run data migrations, enter the following sequence of commands in your terminal from the [`novuhq/novu`](https://github.com/novuhq/novu) repository root:

```bash
npm run setup:project
cd apps/api
npm run migration -- ./migrations/<MIGRATION_PATH>.ts
# e.g. npm run migration -- ./migrations/add-user-contact/add-user-phone.ts
```

Some features may have multiple migrations, in which case you will need to run each migration in the order shown below.
