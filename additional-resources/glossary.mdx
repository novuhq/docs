## Subscribers
Subscribers are entities designated to receive the notifications you send. Each subscriber in Novu is uniquely identified by their `subscriberId`.

## Actor
An `actor` refers to a user or subscriber who initiates actions that trigger events within the system. Each actor is uniquely identified by an "actorId," also known as "subscriberId," which distinguishes them from others. 

Actors hold user-related variables, such as subscriber properties and data payload, containing information like names, emails, and custom data. 

Additionally, actors can enhance notifications by allowing their avatars to be displayed, improving the context and identification of notifications. 


Including actors in event data enables precise tracking and personalization of actions and events in the Novu platform.

## Workflow
Workflow templates define the flow of messages sent to subscribers.
## Topics
Topics facilitate bulk notifications to multiple subscribers simultaneously, streamlining communication.
## Digest Engine
The digest engine aggregates multiple trigger events into a single message, ensuring efficient communication.
## Delay Actions
Delay actions introduce time intervals between workflow steps, optimizing message delivery timing.
## Step Filter
Step filters customize workflow by specifying notification criteria, enhancing communication efficiency.
## Organizations
Organizations allow separation of notifications across multiple products, managed through the Novu web dashboard.

## Environments
Novu runs all your requests in the context of an environment. By default, Novu creates two environments when your account was created, `development` and `production`.
    1. `Development environment`: The development environment is used for testing purposes and validating notification changes prior to committing them to the production environment.
    2. `Production environment`: It will be your live/production environment, you cannot make changes to this environment directly. You will first have to make the changes in the `development` environment and then promote it to `production`. This is a read-only environment.
## Data associated with an environment
        - Subscribers (can’t be promoted to production)
        - Workflows (can be promoted to production)
        - Messages
        - Execution logs
        - Connected integrations (can’t be promoted to production)
        - Notification feeds (can be promoted to production)
        - Brand-related assets and settings
## Team members 
Members of a team have access to the Novu web dashboard. This allows you to have individuals work on and manage templates and notifications.
## Layouts 
Layouts are HTML designs or structures to wrap the content of email notifications. Layouts can be manipulated and assigned to new or existing workflows within the Novu platform, allowing users to create, manage, and assign these layouts to workflows, so they can be reused to structure the appearance of notifications sent through the platform.
