The `useNotifications` hook is a convenient way to fetch the list of notifications.
By default, it fetches both unread and read notifications, but you can apply [filters](/inbox/react/hooks/use-notifications#usenotifications-props) to retrieve only the relevant notifications for your specific use case.

The notifications fetched are paginated, and the hook provides a `fetchMore` function to load more notifications.
The fetched notifications are stored in the notifications array and are appended to the existing notifications as more are loaded.

Any action performed on a notification instance, like marking it as read, will optimistically update the notification, triggering a re-render in the hook and updating the notifications list accordingly, so you don't need to refetch and manually update your UI.
