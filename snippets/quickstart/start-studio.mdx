<Step title="Run the Local Studio">
    The [Local Studio](/workflow/studio) is where you will build your notification workflows and craft the controls that will be
    exposed for your non-technical peers to maintain after your workflow is pushed to your Development or Production
    environments.

        ```bash
        npx novu@latest dev
        ```
        </Tab>
        <Tab title="EU Region">
        ```bash

    The `dev` command is your go-to command whenever you want to build and preview your changes before syncing to cloud. By default, it will start a secure tunnel that our durable cloud workflow engine will
    be able to communicate with, and the [Local Studio](/workflow/studio) web service listening on `http://localhost:2022`
