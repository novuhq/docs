## Fetch Subscriber Feed

A subscriber feed is a list of all In-App messages for a single subscriber. It's a continuous stream of messages displayed in a list that subscribers can scroll through on the frontend via the Notification Center.

It is a dynamic list with **seen** and **unseen** capabilities. Multiple feeds can exist for a subscriber.

<Warning>
  **Subscriber Feed** is very different from **Activity Feed**. The former is
  for In-App channels, while the latter is a list of every message and relevant
  metadata across all channels shown in your dashboard.
</Warning>

The code sample below fetches the list of all In-App messages sent to a specific subscriber:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Node.js 
const { data: inAppMessages } = await novu.subscribers.getNotificationsFeed('subscriberId', {
  page: 0,
  limit: 10,

// it is of type string. By default all feeds messages are fetched
feedIdentifier: 'Marketing',

// seen and read filter of type boolean
seen: true,
read: true
});

```
</CodeGroup>

## Fetch All Feeds

In-App messages are grouped in Feeds. There can be one or multiple feeds.

The code sample below fetches all the feeds that have been created and exist in the In-App steps:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Node.js
const { data: feedsData } = await novu.feeds.get();
```

</CodeGroup>

## Delete a Message From a Feed

A message is a content sent to a single subscriber over a single channel. Some messages are simple, like SMS, while others have more features and capabilities, such as Email, Chat, In-App.

A single message can be deleted from a Feed. The code sample below shows how to do it:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Node.js await novu.messages.deleteById('messageId'); ```
</CodeGroup>

## Fetch all Messages Sent To All Subscribers

You can retrieve all messages sent to all subscribers. There are a couple of filters you can apply to fetch these messages.

- channel: fetches all messages that were sent via a specific channel, e.g Email, Sms, Push, In-App
- subscriberId: fetches all messages sent to a specific subscriber
- transactionIds: fetches all messages via transaction ids.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Node.js 
import { ChannelTypeEnum } from '@novu/node';

// All fields are optional
const listMessagesOptions = {
// pagination options
page: 0,
limit: 20,

/\*\*

- Filter options
  \*/
  // use ChannelTypeEnum.PUSH for push, ChannelTypeEnum.IN_APP for in-app,
  channel: ChannelTypeEnum.EMAIL, // only email type messages will be fetched
  subscriberId: '6444105141ffb0919496dfcb',
  transactionIds: ['644-41051-41ffb0-919496-dfcb'],
  };

const { data: messagesData } = await novu.messages.list(listMessagesOptions);

```
</CodeGroup>

## Mark an In-App Message as Read/Seen

You can mark an In-App message as read/seen. Messages from other channels: **Email**, **Push**, **Chat**, **Sms** can't be marked as read/seen.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Node.js
const { data: markMessageAsRead } = await novu.subscribers.markMessageRead(
  'subscriberId',
  'messageId'
);

const { data: markMessageAsSeen } = await novu.subscribers.markMessageSeen(
  'subscriberId',
  'messageId'
);
```

</CodeGroup>

## Mark an In-App Message as Read/Unread/Seen/Unseen

You can mark an In-App message as read/unread/seen/unseen. Messages from other channels: **Email**, **Push**, **Chat**, **Sms** can't be marked as read/unread/seen/unseen.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Node.js 
const { data: markMessageAs } = await novu.subscribers.markMessageAs(
  'subscriberId',
  'messageId',
  { seen: true, read: false }
);
```
</CodeGroup>

## Mark all In-App Messages as Read/Unread/Seen/Unseen

You can mark all In-App messages as read/unread/seen/unseen.

Messages from other channels: **Email**, **Push**, **Chat**, **Sms** can't be marked as read/unread/seen/unseen.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Node.js 
import { MarkMessagesAsEnum } from "@novu/node"

const { data: markAllInAppMessages } = await novu.subscribers.markAllMessagesAs(
'subscriberId',

// can be filtered with feed identifiers
feedIdentifier: ['Marketing', 'Product']

// MarkMessageAsEnum.READ => It will mark all messages as read
// MarkMessageAsEnum.SEEN => It will mark all messages as seen
// MarkMessageAsEnum.UNREAD => It will mark all messages as unread
// MarkMessageAsEnum.UNSEEN => It will mark all messages as unseen
markAs: MarkMessageAsEnum.Read
);

```
</CodeGroup>

## Send Slack Notifications

You can send notifications to Slack Channels via Novu like so:

```javascript Node.js
import {
  Novu,
  ChatProviderIdEnum
} from '@novu/node';

const novu = new Novu("<NOVU_SECRET_KEY>");

// Identify Subscriber
await novu.subscribers.identify('<SUBSCRIBER_ID>', {
  firstName: 'newSubForSlackChat',
});

// Set credentials for the Subscriber
await novu.subscribers.setCredentials('<SUBSCRIBER_ID>', ChatProviderIdEnum.Slack, {
  webhookUrl: "<WEBHOOK_URL>",
});

// Trigger slack notification
await novu.trigger('slack', {
  to: {
    subscriberId: '<SUBSCRIBER_ID>'
  },
  payload: {
    chatMsg: '<INSERT_MESSAGE_CONTENT>'
  }
});
```

where `chatMsg` is a payload variable in the workflow editor.
