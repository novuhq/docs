# Introduction

In this guide, you'll learn how to use Novu to send notifications directly to a Slack channel. But before coding anything up, we first need to go through a setup process.
The corresponding docs for this guide are available on our [docs](https://docs.novu.co/channels-and-providers/chat/slack).

<Note>
  The entire code of this app (frontend as well as backend) can be found
  [here](https://github.com/novuhq/slack-app).
</Note>

So let's begin!

# Create a Slack App

Creating a Slack app is fairly simple. Follow these steps to create your app:

1. Go to [Slack's app dashboard](https://api.slack.com/apps) and click on the 'Create new App' button, as shown in the image:
   <Frame caption="Create an app from Slack's app dashboard">
     <img src="/images/guides/slack-guide/create-app.png" />{" "}
   </Frame>
2. Choose 'From Scratch' from the following dialog:
   <Frame caption="Select 'From Scratch' in the following dialog">
     <img src="/images/guides/slack-guide/scratch.png" />{" "}
   </Frame>
3. Choose a name for your app and select the Slack workspace in which you want to send notifications:
   <Frame caption="Name your app and select the workspace">
     <img src="/images/guides/slack-guide/name.png" />{" "}
   </Frame>
4. Once you're done, simply click the 'Create App' button:
   <Frame caption="Click on the 'Create App' button">
     <img src="/images/guides/slack-guide/create.png" />{" "}
   </Frame>
5. Once done, you'll be greeted with the screen shown below. We'll make a couple of changes here and it'll be ready to go.
   <Frame caption="Slack greets you with this screen">
     <img src="/images/guides/slack-guide/welcome.png" />{" "}
   </Frame>
6. We'll need `Client Id` from the [Slack Developer's Dashboard](https://api.slack.com/apps) for configuring Slack Integration in the [Novu Web Dashboard](https://dashboard-v2.novu.coovu.coovu.co/integrations?utm_campaign=docs-guides-slack) later, so keep it handy.

   </Frame>

# Create a workflow in the Novu Web Dashboard

1. To create a workflow, head to the workflow section in the [Novu Web Dashboard](https://dashboard-v2.novu.co/workflows?utm_campaign=docs-guides-slack).
2. Click on the 'Add a workflow' button and select 'Blank workflow' from the dropdown.
   <Frame caption="Create a workflow from the Novu Web Dashboard">
     <img src="/images/guides/slack-guide/workflow.png" />{" "}
   </Frame>
3. Once there, give your workflow a name and drag and drop the 'chat' option below the 'workflow trigger' step.
   <Frame caption="Drag and drop the 'chat' option">
     <img src="/images/guides/slack-guide/drag.png" />{" "}
   </Frame>
4. You can also add variables in the Workflow Editor. For example, here I've added 'chatMsg' as a variable as I'll be sending data using it.
   <Frame caption="Configure the step as per your liking">
     <img src="/images/guides/slack-guide/variable.png" />{" "}
   </Frame>
   <Info>Whatever is placed inside double braces is a variable.</Info>
5. Make sure that you've turned on the Slack integration in the [Integrations Store](https://dashboard-v2.novu.co/integrations?utm_campaign=docs-guides-slack).
   <Frame caption="Make sure that Slack integration is set to active">
     <img src="/images/guides/slack-guide/integration.png" />{" "}
   </Frame>
6. To turn the Slack integration on, you'll need `Client Id`. You should have it already but if you don't, you can obtain it from the [Slack Developer's Dashboard](https://api.slack.com/apps).
   <Frame caption="Get 'Client Id' from the Slack developer's dashboard">
     <img src="/images/guides/slack-guide/client-id-Slack.png" />{" "}
   </Frame>
7. Once you have it, you need to plug it into the respective field in the [Slack Integration Settings](https://dashboard-v2.novu.co/integrations?utm_campaign=docs-guides-slack) on the Novu Web Dashboard.

# Create the backend

The backend for this app is quite simple. Simply install the Novu package:

```bash
npm install @novu/node

```

Now, create a route that you'll hit when called from the front end. We'll also need to add it to our Slack app (discussed below). For our demo app, this is the route I've created:

```jsx
import express from "express";
import { chatController } from "../controller/chat.js";

const router = express.Router();

router.post("/sendChat", chatController);

export default router;
```

Now, we need a controller function to handle what is to be sent in the trigger's function payload. Here's the controller I wrote:

```jsx
import { chat } from "../novu/novu.js";

export const chatController = async (req, res) => {
  const { chatMsg } = req.body;
  try {
    await chat(chatMsg);
    res.status(201).json({ message: "Message sent successfully" });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ message: error.message });
  }
};
```

<Info>
  Notice how we're expecting 'chatMsg' in our payload. This is why we added it
  as a variable in the workflow created earlier.
</Info>

To make it modular, weâ€™ll keep the trigger code in a separate function in a separate file, `novu.js`, in our case, which is as follows:

```jsx
import { Novu, ChatProviderIdEnum } from "@novu/node";

export const chat = async (chatMsg) => {
  const novu = new Novu(process.env.YOUR_NOVU_SECRET_KEY_HERE);
  await novu.subscribers.identify(process.env.SUB_ID, {
    firstName: "newSubForSlackChat",
  });

  await novu.trigger("slack", {
    to: {
      subscriberId: process.env.SUB_ID,
    },
    payload: {
      chatMsg: chatMsg,
    },
  });
};
```

In this code snippet above, we're first initializing a new instance of Novu, then using it to 'identify' or [create](https://docs.novu.co/subscribers/subscribers#create-a-subscriber) a [subscriber](https://docs.novu.co/subscribers/subscribers).

<Info>
  The 'identify' method tries to find a subscriber with the given info. If it
  can't find any such subscriber, it creates a new subscriber with the supplied
  info.
</Info>
After creating the subscriber, it runs the trigger code for the workflow we had created.
You can find the trigger workflow by clicking on the 'Get Snippet' button on the
workflow:

<Frame caption="Paste this trigger code in your backend">

</Frame>

# Configure the Slack app

There are two ways to configure the Slack app. One is the Novu managed option and another the manually managed option.
Since the Novu managed is fairly straightforward, I'll demonstrate the manual method here. Follow along to set it up!

1. Goto 'Incoming Webhooks' in your Slack app settings and turn it on.
   <Frame caption="Turn on 'Incoming Webhooks' in your Slack app">
     <img src="/images/guides/slack-guide/on.png" />{" "}
   </Frame>
2. Click on the 'Add New Webhook to Workspace':
   <Frame caption="Click the 'Add New Webhook to Workspace' button">
     <img src="/images/guides/slack-guide/add.png" />{" "}
   </Frame>
3. Now, go ahead and select the channel in which you want to send notifications and click 'allow'.
   <Frame caption="Select the channel">
     <img src="/images/guides/slack-guide/install.png" />{" "}
   </Frame>
4. Then, copy the 'webhookUrl' from Slack.
   <Frame caption="Copy the webhookUrl from Slack">
     <img src="/images/guides/slack-guide/hook.png" />{" "}
   </Frame>
5. Now, add the code below to the backend trigger functionality. Using this code, we are specifying what `webhookUrl` Novu will use to authenticate when using the Slack provider.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Node.js">
```javaScript
import {
  Novu,
  ChatProviderIdEnum
} from '@novu/node';

const novu = new Novu("<NOVU_SECRET_KEY>");

await novu.subscribers.setCredentials('subscriberId', ChatProviderIdEnum.Slack, {
webhookUrl: "<WEBHOOK_URL>",
});

```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="cURL">
```bash
curl -L -X PUT 'https://api.novu.co/v1/subscribers/<SUBSCRIBER_ID>/credentials' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: ApiKey <NOVU_SECRET_KEY>' \
-d '{
  "providerId": "slack",
  "credentials": {
      "webhookUrl": "<WEBHOOK_URL>"
  },
  "integrationIdentifier": "slack-MnGLxp8uy"
}'
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

In our case, we'll add it to the `Novu.js` file we created earlier so that the final file becomes :

```jsx
import { Novu, ChatProviderIdEnum } from "@novu/node";

export const chat = async (chatMsg) => {
  const novu = new Novu(process.env.YOUR_NOVU_SECRET_KEY_HERE);
  await novu.subscribers.identify(process.env.SUB_ID, {
    firstName: "newSubForSlackChat",
  });

  await novu.subscribers.setCredentials(
    process.env.SUB_ID,
    ChatProviderIdEnum.Slack,
    {
      webhookUrl: process.env.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL,
    }
  );

  await novu.trigger("slack", {
    to: {
      subscriberId: process.env.SUB_ID,
    },
    payload: {
      chatMsg: chatMsg,
    },
  });
};
```

6. Finally, we'll add the route we'd created earlier to the redirect URL section, as shown:
   <Frame caption="Add your endpoint to the redirect URL section on Slack">
     <img src="/images/guides/slack-guide/redirect.png" />{" "}
   </Frame>
   <Info>
     For demonstration purposes, I've added both the local as well as the
     deployed URL. You only need one depending on whether you're running this
     locally or have a deployed version.
   </Info>
   Now, our backend is all done, our Slack is all setup and all we need to do is
   hit the URL

# Front end set up

For our demonstration purposes, the front end is pretty basic. All we have to do is have an input field to take the notification text in and send the payload. The front end code for this demo app is available on our [Github repo](https://github.com/novuhq/slack-app/tree/main/frontend).
And here's our app in all its glory!

<Frame caption="Our app in action!">

This is how we send Slack notifications using Novu!
