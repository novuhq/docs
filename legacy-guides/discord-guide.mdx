# Introduction

In this guide, you'll learn how to use Novu to send notifications to any channel in a Discord server. But before coding anything up, we just need to go over a couple of setup steps.
The corresponding docs for this guide are available on our [docs](https://docs.novu.co/channels-and-providers/chat/discord).

<Note>
  The entire code for this app is available on our
  [GitHub](https://github.com/novuhq/discord-chat-app).
</Note>

So let's begin!

# Set up Discord

Setting up Discord is fairly straightforward. You just need the `webhook Url`. It is pretty simple and can be done in the following easy steps:

1. Go to the channel you want to add the webhook to (you need to be an admin of the discord server).

   </Frame>
2. Right-click the channel and select **“Edit Channel”**.

3. Select Integrations -> Webhooks -> Create Webhook

4. Edit the Bot name to your liking, copy the webhook URL and store it somewhere. We'll need it in the future.

# Set up Novu

In this part, we'll set up a workflow that will be triggered when we send a notification. Workflows are like blueprints and hold the entire flow of notifications. You can read more about them on our [docs](https://docs.novu.co/workflows/notification-workflows). To set up a notification workflow for our app, follow these steps:

1. Make sure that you've set the Discord Integration as active from the [Novu Integrations Store](https://dashboard-v2.novu.co/integrations?utm_campaign=docs-discordnotifications).
   <Frame caption="Make sure Discord Integration is active">
     <img src="/images/discord-guide/active.png" />{" "}
   </Frame>
2. Goto the [Novu Web Dashboard](https://dashboard-v2.novu.co/workflows?utm_campaign=docs-discordnotifications).
3. Click on the **"Add a workflow"** button and select **"Blank workflow"** from the dropdown.
   <Frame caption="Create a workflow from the Novu Web Dashboard">
     <img src="/images/guides/slack-guide/workflow.png" />{" "}
   </Frame>
4. Once there, give your workflow a name and drag and drop the **"Chat"** option below the **"Workflow trigger"** step.
   <Frame caption="Drag and drop the **'chat'** option">
     <img src="/images/guides/slack-guide/drag.png" />{" "}
   </Frame>
5. You can also add variables in the **Workflow Editor**. For example, here I've added 'chatMsg' as a variable as I'll be sending data using it.
   <Frame caption="Configure the step as per your liking">
     <img src="/images/discord-guide/chat.png" />{" "}
   </Frame>
   <Info>Whatever is placed inside double braces is a variable.</Info>
6. Click the **"Get Snippet"** button, copy the trigger code and keep it somewhere. We'll need this to trigger this workflow.
   <Frame caption="Copy the trigger code">

   Now, we've completed all the setup required and can move to coding!

# Create the backend

The backend for this app is quite simple. Simply install the Novu package:

```bash
npm install @novu/node

```

Now, create a route that you'll hit when called from the front end. For our demo app, this is the route I've created:

```jsx
import express from "express";
import { chatController } from "../controller/chat.js";

const router = express.Router();

router.post("/sendChat", chatController);

export default router;
```

Now, we need a controller function to handle what is to be sent in the trigger's function payload. Here's the controller I wrote:

```jsx
import { chat } from "../novu/novu.js";

export const chatController = async (req, res) => {
  const { chatMsg } = req.body;
  try {
    await chat(chatMsg);
    res.status(201).json({ message: "Message sent successfully" });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("notifController error:", error);
    res.status(500).json({ message: error.message });
  }
};
```

<Info>
  Notice how we're expecting 'chatMsg' in our payload. This is why we added it
  as a variable in the workflow created earlier.
</Info>
To make it modular, we’ll keep the trigger code in a separate function in a separate
file, `novu.js`, in our case, which is as follows: ```jsx import {
  (Novu, ChatProviderIdEnum)
} from '@novu/node';

export const chat = async (chatMsg) => {
    try {
        const novu = new Novu(process.env.YOUR_NOVU_SECRET_KEY_HERE);

        await novu.subscribers.identify(process.env.SUB_ID, {
            firstName: 'newSubForDiscordChat',
        });

        await novu.subscribers.setCredentials(process.env.SUB_ID, ChatProviderIdEnum.Discord, {
            webhookUrl: process.env.WEBHOOK_URL
        });

    } catch (error) {
        console.log(error);
    }

}

```
Add the trigger code you'd copied earlier:
```jsx
import { Novu } from '@novu/node';

const novu = new Novu('<API_KEY>');

novu.trigger('chat-with-discord', {
    to: {
      subscriberId: '<REPLACE_WITH_DATA>'
    },
    payload: {
      chatMsg: '<REPLACE_WITH_DATA>'
    }
  });
```

Our final trigger code should look something like this:

```jsx
import { Novu, ChatProviderIdEnum } from "@novu/node";

export const chat = async (chatMsg) => {
  try {
    const novu = new Novu(process.env.YOUR_NOVU_SECRET_KEY_HERE);

    await novu.subscribers.identify(process.env.SUB_ID, {
      firstName: "newSubForDiscordChat",
    });

    await novu.subscribers.setCredentials(
      process.env.SUB_ID,
      ChatProviderIdEnum.Discord,
      {
        webhookUrl: process.env.WEBHOOK_URL,
      }
    );

    await novu.trigger("chat-with-discord", {
      to: {
        subscriberId: process.env.SUB_ID,
      },
      payload: {
        chatMsg: chatMsg,
      },
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
};
```

<Info>
  We're keeping all the sensitive data in a `.env` file to avoid hardcoding as a
  good practice
</Info>

In this code snippet above, we're first initializing a new instance of Novu, then using it to 'identify' or [create](https://docs.novu.co/subscribers/subscribers#create-a-subscriber) a [subscriber](https://docs.novu.co/subscribers/subscribers).

<Info>
  The 'identify' method tries to find a subscriber with the given info. If it
  can't find any such subscriber, it creates a new subscriber with the supplied
  info.
</Info>
After creating the subscriber, it runs the trigger code for the workflow we had created.

# Front end set up

For our demonstration purposes, the front-end is pretty basic. All we have to do is have an input field to take the notification text in and send the payload. The front-end code for this demo app is available on our [Github repo](https://github.com/novuhq/discord-chat-app/tree/main/frontend).
And here's our app in all its glory!

This is how we send Discord notifications using Novu!
