Novu provides a real-time embedded notification center widget that can simply be dropped into any web application.

It's available as a drop-in component for React, Vue and Angular apps. For non-specific frameworks, it's also ready as a bundled web component.

We care about the developer experience so much that we also built a headless, zero-UI version to empower you to hand-craft your notification center.
