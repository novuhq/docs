If you're coming from a medium or large team with multiple implementations of sending notifications across channels, then you can be rest assured that Novu will be the central gateway.

- Install Novu's SDK (according to your preferred tech).
- Connect your existing delivery providers to Novu.
- [Migrate your users to subscribers](/concepts/subscribers#bulk-subscriber-creation) on Novu either via Cloud or on-prem.
- Now, every notification fires via Novu.

Teams in charge of content can always update the workflow templates via the dashboard. Engineers can always debug and add as many providers or activate as many more channels needed!
