Debugging notifications can be a hassle. Novu allows you understand and debug notifications sent across different channels in one place.

In [Novu's Activity Feed](https://dashboard-v2.novu.co/activities?utm_campaign=docs-usecases-debug), you can access a log of all the notifications that have been sent & filter through the successful & failed ones. Furthermore, you'll know why it failed!

You can filter through channels, workflows, emails, subscribers and transactions.
