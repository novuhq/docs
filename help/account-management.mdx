### Creating an account

Novu supports [US](https://web.novu.co/auth/signup?utm_campaign=docs-gs-help-account-mgmt) and [EU](https://eu.web.novu.co/auth/signup?utm_campaign=docs-gs-help-account-mgmt) regions based on where you want your data to be stored. In both the regions, a new account can be created using Github, Google, or an Email and Password. We support [SSO](/account/sso) for certain pricing tiers. If you are looking for other ways to signup on Novu, feel free to reach out us at support@novu.co.

### Resetting password
If you have created an account with Novu before, you can reset your password by clicking on `Forgot Your Password?` option on the sign-in page.

### Is US and EU account data synced?
US and EU accounts are completely independent. If you have created an account in the US, you will not be able to login with the same credentials in the EU and vice versa.

### Changing the email associated to my account
If you want to change your account email, please reach out to us at support@novu.co.

### What happens if I change my Github account email?
If you created your Novu account using Github, and you change your email in Github, it will not be reflected in Novu. When you login to Novu using the new Github email, a new account will be created. Please email support@novu.co to update your email address.

### How do I create a new Organization?
A new organization can be created by writing something in the dropdown in the left bottom corner of the dashboard. As soon you start writing something, an add option will apear. This dropdown can also be used to switch between [organizations](/getting-started/concepts#organization). One organization's data is not visible to other organization members.

### How to change organization name?
We are working on account management feature currently so this option is not available in UI as of now. If you want to change your current organization name, [rename organization api](/api-reference/organizations/rename-organization) can be used. if you face any issue in using api or need any help any changing the organization name, please reach out to us at support@novu.co.

### How to upload multiple image assets similar to logo?
Currently, Novu supports uploading only one logo image per organization. If you want to use other images in workflow step content then a valid absolute url of image can be used with `<img>` tag.

### What will happen once free business trial ends?
Novu starts free business trial for 14 days for new organizations. After 14 days, if you have not upgraded to a paid plan, your organization will be automatically downgraded to free tier. If you have added payment details, you will be charged as per the plan you have selected. If you have any billing queries, please reach out to us at sales@novu.co.
