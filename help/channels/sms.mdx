### Why am I getting the error “ subscriber does not have a configured channel”?

This error occurs when a Subscriber is missing `phone` attribute. To fix this error, you need to update the subscriber and set the `phone` attribute with a valid phone number.

### How to change the default sender name for SMS?

First, ensure a custom sendername (sender id or from) is allowed with your Provider. Some countries expect to verify the sender name before using it.

You can change the default sender name for SMS by using [overrides](/integrations/providers/sms/overview) field while triggering the workflow.
