### Creating two In-App Notification Centers in one account
To configure your In-App notifications, you must use the In-App integration from our integration store.

To display in-app notifications to users, any SDKs in our [client library](/notification-center/introduction) can be used. Every library requires `applicationIdentifier` and `subscriberId` to fetch notifications. Currently, only one `applicationIdentifier` is supported per environment per organization. 

Feel free to reach out to us at support@novu.co if you have speicific requirements of multiple `applicationIdentifier` per organization.

### Issues with a redirect URL
To redirect to specified redirect url on clicking the in-app notification, notification click event should be handled in client side code. Here is an example in [React](/notification-center/client/react/get-started#onnotificationclick).

### Changing the default colors of the Notification Center
Styling of your In-App Notification Center can be customized using the [styles](/notification-center/client/react/customization#customization-using-styles-prop) prop. If you want to customize only a single component, you can use [available](/notification-center/client/react/customization#popovernotificationcenter-customization) props.

### Additional Security for In-App Notifications
To add an extra layer of security, we recommend using our HMAC encryption feature to eliminate subscriber impersonation Checkout [HMAC](/notification-center/client/react/get-started#hmac-encryption) section for more details.
