### Creating two In-App Notification Centers in one account

To configure your In-App notifications, you must use the In-App integration from our integration store.

To display in-app notifications to users, any SDKs in our [client library](/inbox/overview) can be used. Every library requires `applicationIdentifier` and `subscriberId` to fetch notifications. Currently, only one `applicationIdentifier` is supported per environment per organization.

Feel free to reach out to us at support@novu.co if you have speicific requirements of multiple `applicationIdentifier` per organization.

### Issues with a redirect URL

To redirect to specified redirect url on clicking the in-app notification, notification click event should be handled in client side code. Here is an example in [React](/inbox/react/get-started).

### Changing the default colors of the Notification Center

Styling of your Inbox can be customized using the [styles](/inbox/react/styling#customization-hierarchy) prop. If you want to customize only a single component, you can use [available](/inbox/react/styling#appearance-prop) props.

### Additional Security for In-App Notifications

To add an extra layer of security, we recommend using our HMAC encryption feature to eliminate subscriber impersonation Checkout [HMAC](/inbox/react/production#hmac-encryption) section for more details.
