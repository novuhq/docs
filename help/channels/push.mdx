Yes, Desktop Push Notifications can be sent by using a Web Push Notification. It is supported with almost all [push channel](/channels-and-providers/push/overview) providers.

### Why am I getting the error “unexpected provider” with FCM?
The possible reasons for this error are:
- Invalid FCM credentials.
- Invalid or stale FCM token.

### Why am I getting the error “Sending message failed due to Requested entity was not found” with FCM?
- This error occurs when the FCM token is invalid or stale. You can fix this by updating the FCM device token.

### Can I store device tokens for particular FCM integration if I have multiple FCM providers active?
- Device tokens for particular FCM integration can be stored using the `integrationIdentifier` field of [update subscriber credentials api](/api-reference/subscribers/update-subscriber-credentials). `integrationIdentifier` is the unique identifier of the integration which is similar to `providerIdentifier`. It can be copied from the integration form.
