### New event triggers are merging an active Digest with an old duration..
When a Digest is created with a set duration and an event is triggered, the Digest stays active ( and will batch the events) until the configured duration is over. 

If you change the duration before the initial time period has completed , the previous digest will still be active and the new duration is merged with the old duration Digest until the previous duration is complete. 

To remove the previous Digest, use [event cancel api](/api-reference/events/cancel-triggered-event) to cancel all event triggers that are still pending and are merged in active Digests.

### Can I dynamically make the Digest inactive??
Yes, Digest supports conditions and can be applied to your Digest step. If the Triggered Event passes the set conditions, then it will be active or inactive based on the condition.

### Can a Subscriber control the Digest duration and time?
Not currently. The Digest duration  can be changed at the Workflow level only and is applied to all subscribers that Workflow is triggered to. If you have an identified use case for this, please let us know at support@novu.co.
