### My Subscribers have preferences set, but the Activity Feed is showing Triggers as being sent.

The Activity Feed is a place each event (workflow trigger) is listed. If a Subscriber has a preference to not receive notifications through a certain channel, Novu’s system will adhere to that. However, this is still a valid Trigger as the fanout occurs before preferences are accommodated.

### What does "step filtered by subscriber preferences" mean in the logs?

It means that the Subscriber has set preferences configured and the step was filtered based on that preference. If the subscriber has disabled a step Channel then, the step will be filtered and notification will not be sent to the subscriber.

### How to export Activity Feed data?

Currently, we don't have any option to export activity feed data. But you can use our [API](/api-reference/notification/get-notifications) to fetch the data. If there is a specific system you’re looking to integrate with, please send us a note at support@novu.co.
