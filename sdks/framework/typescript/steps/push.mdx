The `push` step allows you to send a message to a push channel. This is useful when you need to send a message to a push-enabled channel, such as a mobile app or web app.

<RequestExample>
    ```typescript Push
    await step.push('push', async () => {
        return {
            subject: 'You received a message',
            body: 'A new post has been created',
        };
    });
    ```
</RequestExample>

## Push Output

<ParamField path="subject" type="string" required>
  The subject of the notification.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="body" type="string" required>
  The message to be sent.
</ParamField>

## Push Result

The `push` step does not return any result object.
