## Channel Steps Interface

All channels follow the same shared interface:

<ParamField path="stepId" type="string" required>
  This is the unique identifier for the step in the workflow context. It is used
  to reference and display the step in the dashboard interface.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="resolver" type="Promise" required>
  This is an async function that returns the content of the step which called
  `Outputs`. Each channel has its own output schema.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="options" type="StepOptions">
  Additional step configuration.
</ParamField>

## Options Object

This is an optional configuration object that defines: [Controls Schema](/framework/concepts/inputs), [Provider Overrides](#provider-overrides), skip and other configurations.

<ResponseField
  name="skip"
  type="(controls: InferProperties<controlSchema>) => boolean | Promise<boolean>"
>
  A function that returns a boolean value to skip the step. This is helpful when
  you want to use previous step results or other custom logic to skip the step
  from executing.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="controlSchema" type="JSON Schema | Zod">
  This defined the UI Controls exposed in the dashboard for the step. They can
  be nested and of any JSON Schema supported structure.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="providers" type="ProvidersOverride">
  This object used to access and override the underlying deliver providers SDKs. This is useful when you want to customize the content of the notification with properties that are unique to the provider.
</ResponseField>

### Providers Overrides Object

This object used to access and override the underlying deliver providers SDKs. This is useful when you want to customize the content of the notification with properties that are unique to the provider.

An example of this is the `slack` provider, which allows you to customize the content of the notification with Slack `blocks` to create a rich notification experience.

```typescript
type ProvidersOverride = {
  [key: ProviderEnum]: ProviderCallback;
};

type ProviderCallback = (
  params: ProviderOverridesParams
) => ProviderOverrideOutput | Promise<ProviderOverrideOutput>;

type ProviderOverridesParams = {
  controls: StepControls;
  output: StepOutput;
};

type ProviderOverrideOutput = {
  // A map of the properties used by the Provider.
  // These properties are strongly typed and validated
  // against the underlying provider SDK.
  [key in KnownProviderKey]: KnownProviderValue;
  // The passthrough object is used to pass through
  // the original request to the provider.
  // These properties are not validated.
  _passthrough?: {
    body: Record<string, unknown>;
    headers: Record<string, unknown>;
    query: Record<string, unknown>;
  };
};
```

The `_passthrough` object and the known provider values are deeply merged prior to sending the request to the provider, with the `_passthrough` object taking precedence.


### Workflow channel preferences

By default, Novu will show the subscriber preferences in the Inbox component. Subscribers can enable/disable any active channel in the workflow using subscriber preferences.
With Workflow channel preferences you can control what the default preference for a channel is and also if subscriber can change it.

You can specify inApp, sms, email, chat and push in channels object, each of these takes an object with defaultValue that controls if a channel is enabled/disabled by default for subscriber.
The readOnly property controls if subscriber can change if a channel is enabled/disabled. 
ReadOnly and defaultValue on workflow object is used for a channel that is not specified in channels object so if a new channel is introduced in workflow and specific preferences for that channel is specified these will be used instead. 
These preferences can also be controlled from the Novu dashboard on a workflow, click on the cog and then preferences to do this.

```typescript
const newWorkflow = workflow(
  'hello-world-preferences',
  async ({ step }) => {
    await step.inApp('send-in-app', () => ({
      subject: 'Welcome!',
      body: 'Hello there',
    }));
  },
  {
    preferences: {
      workflow: {
        defaultValue: false,
        readOnly: true,
      },
      channels: {
        inApp: {
          defaultValue: true,
          readOnly: true,
        },
      },
    },
  }
);
```
