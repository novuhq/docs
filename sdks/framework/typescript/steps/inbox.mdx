The `inbox` step allows you to send a message to your Inbox component. This is useful when you need to send a message to a user's inbox, such as a mobile app or web app.

<RequestExample>
    ```typescript Inbox
    await step.inApp('inbox', async () => {
        return {
          subject: 'Welcome to Acme!',
          body: 'We are excited to have you on board.',
          avatar: 'https://acme.com/avatar.png',
          primaryAction: {
            label: 'Get Started',
            url: 'https://acme.com/get-started',
          },
          secondaryAction: {
