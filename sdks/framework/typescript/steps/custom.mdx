The `custom` step allows you to execute any custom code as a step in the workflow and persist the result to the workflow state. This is useful when you need to ensure a step is executed only once, or when you need to execute a step that is not supported by the SDK.

The `custom` step is typically used when you need to retrieve data from your own system, such as user data, then use that data for content of subsequent channel step content. By using a `custom` step to persist data once, you can avoid making repeated calls to your system and improve the performance of your workflow whilst reducing load on your system.

<RequestExample>
    ```typescript Custom Step
    await step.custom('custom', async () => {
        return {
            hello: 'world',
        }
    }, {
        outputSchema: z.object({
            hello: z.string(),
        }),
    });
    ```
</RequestExample>

<ResponseExample>
  ```typescript Custom Step Result 
  const { hello } = await step.custom('custom', resolver);
  ```
</ResponseExample>
