  This SDK is built and maintained by our community and might not be up to date with the latest Novu features. We are currently working on a new official SDK for PHP.
</Warning>

Novu's PHP SDK provides simple, yet comprehensive notification management, and delivery capabilities through multiple channels that you can implement using code that integrates seamlessly with your PHP application.
