use Novu\Laravel\Facades\Novu;

$response = Novu::triggerEvent([
    'name' => '<WORKFLOW_TRIGGER_IDENTIFIER_FROM_DASHBOARD>',
    'payload' => ['customVariables' => 'Hello'],
    'to' => [
        'subscriberId' => '<SUBSCRIBER_ID_FROM_DASHBOARD>',

novu()->triggerEvent([
    'name' => '<WORKFLOW_TRIGGER_IDENTIFIER_FROM_DASHBOARD>',
    'payload' => ['customVariables' => 'Hello'],
    'to' => [
        'subscriberId' => '<SUBSCRIBER_ID_FROM_DASHBOARD>',
