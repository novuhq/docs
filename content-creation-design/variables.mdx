Novu's content creation tools allow developers to utilize a wealth of variables when designing notification workflows. 

As developers construct workflows using Novu, certain status facets—results of batch functions and other steps in the workflow—are auto-generated and can be utilized to control the content displayed in notification templates.

These variables offer dynamic and automated properties that hold subscriber information, such as first and last name, email, phone, and avatar. 

For example, developers can insert a subscriber's first name into a workflow by using `{{ subscriber.firstName }}`.

In addition to the subscriber's details, developers can use data payload variables that encapsulate dynamic data meant to be injected into the content of a workflow. 

For instance, in the code example the variables username and resetLink are data payload variables that would be adjusted based on the workflow's purpose.

**The utilization of these variables allows Novu to deliver personalized notifications to the receiver, thus improving user experience and accomplishing better communication outcomes.**

## System Variables

| `data`        | `Object` | An additional object that can hold custom actor data as key-value pairs. |

### Step Variables

## Data Payload Variables

Data payload variables encompass the dynamic data intended to be injected into the content of a workflow. These variables are integral components of the payload object, forming part of the parameters for the trigger function.

Here's a more illustrative example of how data payload variables can be employed:

```jsx
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.novu.co/v1/events/trigger' \
     --header 'Authorization: ApiKey <REPLACE_WITH_API_KEY>' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data-raw '{
         "name": "password-reset",
         "to": {
           "subscriberId": "6427e97d0136cef86a315c46",
           "email": "john.doe@acme.com"
         },
         "payload": {
					 "username": "Jhontheman1969",
           "resetLink": "http://sample.info/password.reset",
           "securityEmail": "john.doe.backup@acme.com",
         }
       }'
```

Within this code snippet, the variables `username` and `resetLink` are representative of data payload variables. 

Importantly, it's worth noting that the payload itself can encompass any serializable JSON object.

<Info>Avoid use of system reserved variables as normal variables. For example don't use `email` as variable name because `{{subscriber.email}}` is a system reserved variable</Info>
