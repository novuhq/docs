Self-hosting Novu involves setting up and maintaining your communication infrastructure using your own servers.
While this offers full control and customization,
some features which are available only for Novuâ€™s cloud-managed won't be available in a self-hosted environment.

## Minimum System Requirements
For basic installation, a server with 16GB RAM and 8 CPUs is fine. However, specifications vary depending on requirements and here are sample specifications for handling 1M plus notifications:

- If everything is running on one machine, then at least 36 vCPU and 64GB of RAM.
- If services are running across containers, then it is recommended to run 3 containers per service, each container having 2 vCPU and 4GB of RAM.
- If you're using Kubernetes, then the K8 system needs to have 36 vCPU and 64GB of RAM at least in the cluster to run the servers.
- On AWS, a c6g.8xlarge instance with 32 vCPU and 64GB of RAM. 
- In all cases, you need to also have 2 Redis clusters with the queue one having an Append only log file active (AOL) to prevent instances of job loss during an outage,  a MongoDB cluster equivalent to a M20 or greater on Atlas, and 10GB of S3 storage.
- Lastly, the queue Redis instance should be 8GB MINIMUM as there needs to be enough space to handle spikes in notifications or the whole system will brick.

<Note>Note that these specifications are subject to your requirements, the scale of your operations, and should be adjusted as needed.</Note>
