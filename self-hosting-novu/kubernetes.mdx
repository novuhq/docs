<Warning>
  We do not plan to support any official public kubernetes deployment at this
  time. This guide is to help assist advanced users who want to deploy Novu on
  their own kubernetes cluster.
</Warning>

Kubernetes is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

You can find a community driven [helm deployment](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/next/docker/kubernetes/helm/README.md) in our repository.

## Novu Web Container Does not Run on Kubernetes

Due to the way we build our web container image,
you will need to build your own image and push it to your own registry.
This is due to us compiling the frontend when the container starts.

You can follow our [dev-deploy-web workflow](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/blob/next/.github/workflows/dev-deploy-web.yml)
to see how we build our web container image.
You can also use this workflow to build your own image, you will just need to remove all of the steps after the deploy to netlify step.

<Note>
  Only need to do this IF you do not allow root only access on your cluster.
