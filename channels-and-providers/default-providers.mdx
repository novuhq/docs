## Novu Providers

<Info>
The default email and sms providers are for evaluation purpose only and their use in production-grade apps is not recommended. You should switch to any of our [numerous other providers](/additional-resources/glossary#3-providers) for production apps. Also, there are two modes for default Novu providers - Development and Production.

## Novu In-app Provider
In addition to email and sms, we also have in-app provider:

It is the only provider for the in-app channel and it *can be used in production apps*. Unlike sms and email, it is not active by default and needs to be turned on separately. It can be scaled as per your need and it is a 'pay as you go' offering. You can check [this](https://novu.co/pricing/) for more details.
