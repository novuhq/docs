When using Slack you will have to save the integration credentials in the subscriber entity.

This guide will walk you through the steps needed to obtain the `webhookUrl` that Novu requires to send chat messages to your customers.

We will provide the basic flow that the user needs to perform, to successfully send notifications via the Slack integration.

<Note>We've a [dedicated guide](/guides/slack-guide) on integrating Novu in a Slack app.</Note>

### Creating application

This step is optional, if you already have a Slack application you can reuse it.

1. Go to Slack's developer dashboard https://api.slack.com/apps.
2. Create a new application.

### Generating Webhook Urls for your subscribers

There are two ways to generate webhook URLs - Novu Managed (recommended) and manually managed. Let’s look at both of them in detail:

### 1. Novu Managed (Recommended)

If you use this approach, then Novu will manage the OAuth flow and store the credentials

1. Configure your Slack application as mentioned below.
2. Add the `Add to Slack` button or the `Shareable URL` to your application in order to request permission for access (scope: incoming-webhook).    
<Note>
Make sure you use the generated `Shareable URL` that you can find under the Slack integration form in the [Integration Store](https://web.novu.co/integrations). The `Shareable URL` should have the following format:
</Note>
```bash
https://api.novu.co/v1/subscribers/SUBSCRIBER_ID/credentials/slack/oauth?environmentId=ENVIRONMENT_ID&integrationIdentifier=INTEGRATION_IDENTIFIER.

```

- `SUBSCRIBER_ID` is a custom identifier used when identifying your users within the Novu platform.
- `ENVIRONMENT_ID` is a context of an environment you can locate your environment id in the setting in the [dashboard settings](https://web.novu.co/settings).
- `INTEGRATION_IDENTIFIER` (optional) is a unique identifier of the integration. You can locate your integration identifier in the [Integration Store](https://web.novu.co/integrations). When not provided the last created integration will be used.
If you are using the `Add to Slack` button you have to provide the `Shareable URL` as the `redirect_uri` parameter like in this example. Make sure that the `Shareable URL` is URL encoded:

```html
<a
  href="https://slack.com/oauth/v2/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID&scope=incoming-webhook&user_scope=&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.novu.co%2Fv1%2Fsubscribers%2FSUBSCRIBER_ID%2Fcredentials%2Fslack%2Foauth%3FenvironmentId%3DENVIRONMENT_ID%26integrationIdentifier%3DINTEGRATION_IDENTIFIER"

      https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack@2x.png 2x
    "
/></a>

```

### 2. Manually managed
To use the manually managed option, you need to generate a `webhookUrl` and plug it into your backend. 
1. Goto 'Incoming Webhooks' in your Slack app settings and turn it on.
<Frame caption="Turn on 'Incoming Webhooks' in your Slack app"><img src="/images/guides/slack-guide/on.png" /> </Frame>
2. Click on the 'Add New Webhook to Workspace':
<Frame caption="Click the 'Add New Webhook to Workspace' button"><img src="/images/guides/slack-guide/add.png" /> </Frame>
3. Now, go ahead and select the channel in which you want to send notifications and click 'allow'.
<Frame caption="Select the channel"><img src="/images/guides/slack-guide/install.png" /> </Frame>
4. Then, copy the 'webhookUrl' from Slack.
<Frame caption="Copy the webhookUrl from Slack"><img src="/images/guides/slack-guide/hook.png" /> </Frame>
5. Now, you need to save the `webhookUrl` on the relevant subscriber entity in Novu. Here's an example to do the same using our Node SDK:

## Update credential webhookUrl

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Node.js">
```javaScript
import {
  Novu,
  ChatProviderIdEnum
} from '@novu/node';

const novu = new Novu("<NOVU_API_KEY>");

await novu.subscribers.setCredentials('subscriberId', ChatProviderIdEnum.Slack, {
  webhookUrl: "<WEBHOOK_URL>",
});
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="cURL">
```bash 
curl -L -X PUT 'https://api.novu.co/v1/subscribers/<SUBSCRIBER_ID>/credentials' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: ApiKey <NOVU_API_KEY>' \
-d '{
  "providerId": "slack",
  "credentials": {
      "webhookUrl": "<WEBHOOK_URL>"
  },
  "integrationIdentifier": "slack-MnGLxp8uy"
}'
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Checkout the [API reference](/api-reference/subscribers/update-subscriber-credentials) for more details.

- `subscriberId` is a custom identifier used when identifying your users within the Novu platform.
- `providerId` is a unique provider identifier. We recommend using our ChatProviderIdEnum.Slack if you’re using Node, else string of Slack to specify the provider.
- The third parameter is the credentials object. In this case, we use the `webhookUrl` property to specify the webhook URL generated in the previous step.

6. You are all set up and ready to send your first chat message via our @novu/node package or directly using the REST API.

## Configuring Slack application

1. Go to OAuth & Permissions on Slack's Developer Dashboard and add your REDIRECT_URL in Redirect URLs.
    - If you use a manual Management solution, add the API endpoint you created on Step 1.
    - If you use the Novu Managed solution add `https://api.novu.co/v1/subscribers`.
2. Go to Incoming Webhooks from the left menu and Activate Incoming Webhooks.
3. Go to Manage Distribution and at the bottom of the page, tick Remove Hard Coded Information and Activate Public Distribution.

### Enabling HMAC Encryption

In order to enable Hash-Based Message Authentication Codes, you need to do the following steps:

1. Visit the integration store page and enable HMAC encryption under your chat provider.
2. The next step would be to generate an HMAC encrypted subscriberId on your backend:
    
    ```jsx
    import { createHmac } from 'crypto';
    
    const hmacHash = createHmac('sha256', process.env.NOVU_API_KEY)
      .update(subscriberId)
      .digest('hex');
    
    ```
    
3. Add the newly created hash HMAC to the Sharable URL as a query.

This concludes the Slack provider guide.
