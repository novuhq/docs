When using Slack you will have to save the integration credentials in the subscriber entity.

This guide will walk you through the steps needed to obtain the `webhookUrl` that Novu requires to send chat messages to your customers.

We will provide the basic flow that the user needs to perform, to successfully send notifications via the Slack integration.

### Creating application

This step is optional, if you already have a Slack application you can reuse it.

1. Go to Slack's developer dashboard https://api.slack.com/apps.
2. Create a new application.

### Generating Webhook Urls for your subscribers

There are two ways to generate webhook URLs - Novu Managed (recommended) and manually managed. Let’s look at both of them in detail:

### 1. Novu Managed (Recommended)

If you use this approach, then Novu will manage the OAuth flow and store the credentials

1. Configure your Slack application as mentioned below.
2. Add the `Add to Slack` button or the `Shareable URL` to your application in order to request permission for access (scope: incoming-webhook).    
<Note>
Make sure you use the generated `Shareable URL` that you can find under the Slack integration form in the [Integration Store](https://web.novu.co/integrations). The `Shareable URL` should have the following format:
</Note>
```bash
https://api.novu.co/v1/subscribers/SUBSCRIBER_ID/credentials/slack/oauth?environmentId=ENVIRONMENT_ID&integrationIdentifier=INTEGRATION_IDENTIFIER.

```

- `SUBSCRIBER_ID` is a custom identifier used when identifying your users within the Novu platform.
- `ENVIRONMENT_ID` is a context of an environment you can locate your environment id in the setting in the [dashboard settings](https://web.novu.co/settings).
- `INTEGRATION_IDENTIFIER` (optional) is a unique identifier of the integration. You can locate your integration identifier in the [Integration Store](https://web.novu.co/integrations). When not provided the last created integration will be used.
If you are using the `Add to Slack` button you have to provide the `Shareable URL` as the `redirect_uri` parameter like in this example. Make sure that the `Shareable URL` is URL encoded:

```html
<a
  href="https://slack.com/oauth/v2/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID&scope=incoming-webhook&user_scope=&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.novu.co%2Fv1%2Fsubscribers%2FSUBSCRIBER_ID%2Fcredentials%2Fslack%2Foauth%3FenvironmentId%3DENVIRONMENT_ID%26integrationIdentifier%3DINTEGRATION_IDENTIFIER"

      https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack@2x.png 2x
    "
/></a>

```

### 2. Manually managed

### Configuring HTTPS server:
Create a new endpoint on your server that will handle the following steps (you can use Request Bin for an easy HTTPS service for redirects):

1. Listen for redirect requests to your endpoint (REDIRECT_URL) after the user completes step 5 and grants permissions. Make sure to store the 'code' parameter from the request query as it will be needed later.
2. Send a POST request to https://slack.com/api/oauth.v2.access with the following request body: Use the "Client ID" and "Client Secret" from Slack's Developer Dashboard under "Basic Information". The request body should be in the format: `{ code: string, client_id: string, client_secret: string }`. Store the webhook URL from the response, which can be found under `response.data.incoming_webhook.url`. (read more on Slack's documentation here)
3. When the `incoming_webhook.url` is obtained you need to save it on the relevant subscriber entity in Novu you can use the Node SDK:
    
    ```jsx
    import { Novu, ChatProviderIdEnum } from '@novu/node';

    const novu = new Novu(process.env.NOVU_API_KEY);

    const body = req.body; // From your HTTPS listener
    await novu.subscribers.setCredentials('subscriberId', ChatProviderIdEnum., {
    webhookUrl: body.incoming_webhook.url,
    });
    ```

    - subscriberId is a custom identifier used when identifying your users within the Novu platform.
- providerId is a unique provider identifier. We recommend using our ChatProviderIdEnum.Slack if you're using Node, else string of `Slack` to specify the provider.
- The third parameter is the credentials object. In this case, we use the webhookUrl property to specify the webhook URL generated in the previous step.

<aside>
💡 Note: You need to set credentials for every subscriber because Slack generates a new Webhook URL on every new app install.

4. Configure your Slack application as mentioned below.
5. Add the `Add to Slack` button or the shareable URL to your application in order to request permission for access (scope: incoming-webhook).
6. After the end-user finishes the authorization you will get the webhookUrl from the response of the OAuth under `body.incoming_webhook.url`, which you will use in step 3.
7. You are all set up and ready to send your first chat message via our @novu/node package or directly using the REST API.

## Configuring Slack application

1. Go to OAuth & Permissions on Slack's Developer Dashboard and add your REDIRECT_URL in Redirect URLs.
    - If you use a manual Management solution, add the API endpoint you created on Step 1.
    - If you use the Novu Managed solution add `https://api.novu.co/v1/subscribers`.
2. Go to Incoming Webhooks from the left menu and Activate Incoming Webhooks.
3. Go to Manage Distribution and at the bottom of the page, tick Remove Hard Coded Information and Activate Public Distribution.

### Enabling HMAC Encryption

In order to enable Hash-Based Message Authentication Codes, you need to do the following steps:

1. Visit the integration store page and enable HMAC encryption under your chat provider.
2. The next step would be to generate an HMAC encrypted subscriberId on your backend:
    
    ```jsx
    import { createHmac } from 'crypto';
    
    const hmacHash = createHmac('sha256', process.env.NOVU_API_KEY)
      .update(subscriberId)
      .digest('hex');
    
    ```
    
3. Add the newly created hash HMAC to the Sharable URL as a query.

This concludes the Slack provider guide.
