## Introduction

This example demonstrates how to send a digest notification email by batching different types of notifications from multiple workflows using the Novu Framework. The digest notification email is sent to the user with a summary of all the notifications that have been triggered by different workflows.

**Use case**: Linear is a project management tool that allows users to create and manage projects and tickets. When someone comments on the ticket, someone assigns the ticket to the user or there can be more events for which the user has turned on the Notification, the user receives a notification. The user can receive multiple notifications in a short period. To avoid spamming the user with multiple emails, Linear sends a digest notification email that contains a summary of all the notifications.

## Code Example
import { workflow } from "@novu/framework";
import { renderLinearDigestEmail } from "../../emails/linear-digest";
import {
  ticketAssignedPayloadSchema,
  commentOnTicketPayloadSchema,
} from "./schemas";

```typescript Worklflow to digest all notifications from different workflows
export const multiDigestWorkflow = workflow(
  "multi-digest",
  async ({ step }) => {
    // Digest all notifications from different workflows
    const digestedNotifications = await step.digest(
      "digest-all-notifications",
      async () => {
        return {
          amount: 4,
          unit: "hours",
        };
      }
    );

    // Send digested notifications via email
    await step.email("send-email", async () => {
      return {
        subject: `${digestedNotifications.events.length} unread notifications on Novu - Linear`,
        body: renderLinearDigestEmail(digestedNotifications.events),
      };
    });
  }
);
```

```typescript Workflow to send notification when someone comments on a ticket
import { workflow } from "@novu/framework";
import { renderLinearDigestEmail } from "../../emails/linear-digest";
import {

... 

export const someoneCommentedOnTicket = workflow(
  "someone-commented-on-ticket",
  async ({ step, payload, subscriber }) => {
    await step.inApp("send-inbox-notification", async () => {
      return {
        body: `${payload.comment.author.userName} commented ${payload.comment.text} on ticket ${payload.ticket.id}`,
      };
    });

    await step.custom("digest-the-message", async () => {
      try {
        await multiDigestWorkflow.trigger({
          to: subscriber?.subscriberId as string,
          payload: {},
        });

      }
    });
  },
