The Inbox component enables a rich context-aware in-app notifications center directly in your application, and with minimal effort.

Novu provides a pre-built, ready-to-use, and customizable Inbox UI component. It's in React today, and soon will be available in other popular frameworks including Vue, React Native, and full headless.

## Why use the Novu Inbox?

- You want to notify users directly within your application.
- Pre-built UI components make the Inbox easy to include.
- Highly customizable and can be made to exactly match your existing branding and design.
- Users can access powerful subscriber preferences management direct from the Inbox.
- Provide a multi-tab notification experience.
- Synchronize notifications across devices in real-time, powered by web sockets.
- Secure your connection using HMAC encryption.

## Concepts

1. `Subscriber` - is your product user who will receive the notifications through the In-App channel.
2. `Notification` - is a message sent to the subscriber using an In-App channel (step) in the workflow.
3. `Notifications list` - the list of all notifications sent to a particular subscriber.
4. `Tabs` - allows to switch between notifications lists where the notifications can be grouped by particular workflow tags.
5. `Notification actions` - are the buttons below notification content that can be clicked to perform any action or external API call.
6. `Redirect URL` - when a single notification item from the list is clicked then it can be configured to perform an action or redirect to any URL.
