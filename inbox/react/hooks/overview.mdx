The `@novu/react` package offers an interface that enables you to build a custom notifications UI using React hooks that are powered by real-time data from the Novu services.

These hooks are designed for use in both mobile and web applications, offering a flexible approach to building a custom notifications UI tailored to your application's requirements.

### Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with building your custom inbox UI:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the @novu/react package">
    ```bash 
    npm install @novu/react 
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implement the NovuProvider">
    To implement the [NovuProvider](/inbox/react/hooks/novu-provider) component, you need to place it in your application's code at the tree level where you want the hooks to be accessible. Here's how you can do it:
    <NovuProviderExample />
    <Tip>
      You can find the `applicationIdentifier` in the Novu Dashboard under the [API
      keys page](https://dashboard.novu.co/api-keys). The `subscriberId` is the
      unique identifier of the user in your application, learn more about
      subscribers [here](/concepts/subscribers).
    </Tip>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create the custom Inbox UI">
    For example, you can create a custom popover UI with a bell icon that shows the unread notifications count and a list of notifications.
    ```tsx 
    const YourCustomInbox = () => {
      return (
        <Popover.Root open={...} onOpenChange={...}>
          <Popover.Trigger>
            <BellButton />
          </Popover.Trigger>
          <Popover.Content>
            <NotificationsList />
          </Popover.Content>
        </Popover.Root>
      );
    };
    ```

    The `BellButton` component fetches the unread notifications count and renders the count value in the indicator.

    <UseUnreadCountExample />

    The `NotificationsList` component retrieves and displays the notifications list with infinite scrolling functionality.

    <UseNotificationsExample />

    The `NotificationItem` component renders each notification item.

    When any action is performed on the `notification` instance for example "read" button is clicked,
    the SDK will optimistically update notification that will result in the `useNotifications` hook rerender, so yo don't need to refetch and manually update your UI.

    ```tsx
    const NotificationItem = ({ notification }) => {
      return (
        <div>
          {notification.isRead && <span className="dot-indicator">}
          <h3>{notification.subject}</h3>
          <p>{notification.body}</p>
          <button onClick={() => notification.read()}>Read</button>
          <button onClick={() => notification.archive()}>Archive</button>
        </div>
      );
    };
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>
