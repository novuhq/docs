Novu provides the `@novu/react` package that helps to add a fully functioning Inbox to your web application in minutes. Let's see how easily you can use it in your application.


<Steps>
    <Step title="Install the Inbox package">
      ```bash
      npm install @novu/react
      ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add the inbox code to your react file">
      ```tsx
      import { Inbox } from '@novu/react';

      function Novu() {
        return (
          <Inbox
            applicationIdentifier="YOUR_APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER"
            subscriberId="YOUR_SUBSCRIBER_ID"
          />
        );
      }
      ```

      💡 You can find the `applicationIdentifier` in the Novu Dashboard under the [API keys page](https://dashboard.novu.co/api-keys).
      The `subscriberId` is the unique identifier of the user in your application, learn more about subscribers [here](/concepts/subscribers).

    </Step>
    <Step title="Trigger a notification">
      Now that you have the inbox component added to your application, you can trigger an Inbox notification to see it in action.
      To create your first workflow, follow our [quickstart guide](/quickstart/overview).
