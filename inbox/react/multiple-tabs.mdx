Novu enables the creation of a multi-tab experience for the Inbox, allowing you to filter and display notification lists within distinct UI tabs.

### Defining tabs

Define the `tabs` prop to display multiple tabs in the Inbox component.

Each tab object should include a `label` and `value` properties. The `label` property represents the text displayed on the specific tab. The `value` property is an array of strings that serves as the "filter criteria" for the notifications displayed in the list.

The notifications are filtered and matched by comparing the notification `tags` field with the tab `value` field. The notifications that contain at least one tag from the tab `value` field are displayed in the list.

The tags on the notification are copied from the [workflow definition options](/sdks/framework/typescript/workflow) during the workflow execution process. You can combine tags from different workflows to create a customized tab experience.

The example below demonstrates how to define multiple tabs in the Inbox component.

```tsx
import { Inbox } from '@novu/react';

const tabs = [
  {
    label: 'All Notifications',
    value: [],
  },
  {
    label: 'Newsletter',
    value: ['newsletter'],
  },
  {
    label: 'React',
    value: ['react'],
  },
];

function Novu() {
  return (
    <Inbox
      applicationIdentifier="YOUR_APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER"
      subscriberId="YOUR_SUBSCRIBER_ID"
      tabs={tabs}
    />
  );
}
```
