---

The headless version of Novu’s notification library package provides users with a lightweight solution for integrating notification functionality into their web applications. With just the essential API methods, users can easily incorporate our notification system into any framework or vanilla JavaScript project, without being constrained by our default UI or dependencies. The SDK includes real-time notifications through a WebSocket connection and can be safely used across web and mobile platforms, including React Native.

## Realtime Notifications

Events are emitted when notifications are received, and when the unread notificatons count changes. `novu.on()` is used to listen to these events.

```typescript
novu.on("notifications.notification_received", (data) => {
  console.log("new notification =>", data);
});

novu.on("notifications.unread_count_changed", (data) => {
  console.log("new unread notifications count =>", data);
});
```
