The delay action awaits a specified amount of time before moving on to trigger the following steps of the workflow.

### Delay Action Node

After adding a delay node in the workflow editor, the immediate next step will only be triggered after the specified period of time has elapsed.

# Configurations

## Regular Delay

Regular Delay will determine how long it will take before triggering the next step.

## Time Interval

You can specify the amount and time unit that best suits your needs.

Should you wish to, you could override the default delay time interval you set in the creation of the delay node.

```tsx
novu.trigger('template-name', {
  to: {
    subscriberId: '<SUBSCRIBER_ID>'
  },
  payload: {
    name: 'Hello',
  },
  overrides: {
    delay: {
      unit: 'days',
      amount: 2,
    },
  },
});

```

## Scheduled Delay

Scheduled Delay allows delaying up to a future date before continuation of steps execution. All steps after delay node will be triggered only after said date.

### Payload Path[](https://docs.novu.co/platform/delay#payload-path)

Payload path will determine the path in payload for the scheduled date.

That path must be included in your payload on trigger execution and must be a date in strict ISO format.

For example:

<img
  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
  src="/images/Deley-action-properties.png"
/>

```tsx
novu.trigger('workflow-name', {
  to: {
    subscriberId: '<SUBSCRIBER_ID>'
  },
  payload: {
    sendAt: '2022-09-21T10:48:44.388Z',
  },
});

```

<Note>
Date must be in ISO date format of YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.SSSZ
