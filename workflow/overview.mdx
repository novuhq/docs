The Workflow Editor is a robust visual tool in Novu that empowers both no-code users and developers to design advanced notification workflows.
It seamlessly combines the intuitive simplicity of no-code building blocks with the adaptability and precision of code-based customization.
### What is a Workflow?

A workflow in Novu serves as a container for all notification / message logic and templates within your system. 

Each workflow:

- Has a unique identifier (key)
- Executes for one subscriber at a time (e.g. user, recipient, customer, etc.)
- Contains complete notification / message logic and templates
- Supports subscriber preference management
- Can be triggered via API calls, events, or scheduled operations
