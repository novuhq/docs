<Warning> The **Custom** action step is currently available only when using the [**Novu Framework**](/framework/overview) for code-based Workflows. </Warning>

The **Custom** action step empowers you to execute custom logic and maintain its state within the durable execution context of a workflow. This step's output can seamlessly feed into subsequent steps of the **Workflow**, enabling powerful and dynamic workflows tailored to your needs.

Common Use Cases:

- **API Integrations**: Make API calls to third-party services for data retrieval, updates, or triggering external actions.
- **Database Queries**: Fetch data from a database to dynamically adapt subsequent steps in your **Workflow**.
- **Data Transformation**: Execute custom logic to process, manipulate, or enhance data before passing it forward.
- **Custom Provider Implementation**: Build and integrate custom providers to extend functionality as needed.
- **Subscriber Tagging**: Add **Tags** to **Subscribers** (users) at specific workflow steps.
    - Examples of **Tags**:
        - Tag users with the **Workflow** and **Step** they are on to create **Segments, Topics** or target specific groups later.
        - Use tags to trigger **In-App** notification as part of the user **Workflow** journey. For example, tag users at a key step, then set up an **In-App** notification targeting everyone with that **Tag**.

With **Custom Action**, you can craft highly personalized and intelligent **Workflows**, ensuring flexibility and precision in your notification journey **Workflows**.
