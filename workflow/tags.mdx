**Tags** act like labels or categories that help you organize and manage notifications in your app. By grouping notifications under specific tags, you can better control how they’re filtered, displayed, or managed by both your app and your users.

For example, you might want to group all security-related notifications together, separate from updates about account activity or promotional offers.

## Why Use Tags?

- **Filtering Notifications**: Tags make it easy to filter and display notifications based on categories. 
For instance, you can create a UI that allows users to view only security or promotional notifications.
- **[Preference Management](/inbox/react/components/preferences)**: With tags, users can manage their notification preferences by category, choosing to enable or mute specific types of notifications.

Think of it as organizing emails into folders—tags help keep things tidy and manageable for both you and your users.

## Best Practices for Using Tags

- **Define Categories Early**: Identify key notification categories for your app, such as security, promotions, or updates.
- **Consistent Naming**: Use clear and consistent tag names to avoid confusion (e.g., prefer security over sec_alert).
- **Keep It Manageable**: Avoid overloading with too many tags. Focus on meaningful groupings that provide real value.

Tags are a powerful way to streamline your notification system, helping users stay organized and informed while giving you greater control over your app’s notification behavior.
