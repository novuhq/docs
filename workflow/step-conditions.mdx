**Step Conditions** allow you to customize a **Subscriber's** workflow journey using their **Data**, **Topics**, or prior behavior.

For instance, if a **Subscriber** doesn’t **See** or **Read** an **In-App Notification Step** within a specific time (e.g., X minutes), you can automatically trigger a **Mobile Push Notification Step** to engage them through another channel. These features enable more sophisticated, personalized notification workflows, boosting engagement and communication.

### Levels of conditions

You can apply conditions at three levels:

1. **Step-Level Conditions**
    
    Define whether an individual step within a workflow should execute during a workflow run.
    
    <Tip> Example: Send an email only if the preceding in-app notification hasn’t been seen or read.</Tip>
    
2. **Channel-level conditions**
    
    Control execution of steps using a specific channel across all workflow runs.

    <Tip> Example: Trigger SendGrid email channel steps only in the production environment.</Tip>

    
3. **Preference-level conditions**
    
    Manage notification preferences available during a workflow run.

    <Tip> Example: Allow recipients to mute notifications for specific product resources.</Tip>
