Each channel step in a Novu workflow comes with its own notification template. This template defines how notifications appear for a specific channel.

Quality templates are used to create personalized, visually appealing, and effective notifications.

- **Injecting variables from your trigger data into your notification template.**
- **Using Liquid syntax for logic and control flow within templates.**
- **Previewing and testing your notification templates.**

## Personalizing Notifications with Template Variables

To insert a variable into your Novu notification template, use double curly braces: `{{ variable_name }}`.

Novu templates allow you to reference several types of variables:

### Data payload variables
These variables originate from the data payload in your workflow trigger. 
For example, if you include `{ "order_id": "12345" }` in your payload, you can reference it in your template as `{{ payload.order_id }}`.

### User properties
You can access user properties (like `firstName` or custom subscriber properties) using `{{ subscriber.* }}`. For instance:

```liquid
Hi {{ subscriber.firstName }},

You’ve been upgraded to the {{ subscriber.data.plan }} plan.

Thanks,  
The Novu Team
```

## Adding logic with Liquid Filters

Novu supports Liquid filters to add dynamic and conditional content to your notifications. Below are examples of how to use the top 10 Liquid filters in real-world notification templates.

### `downcase`

Use `downcase` for consistent email formatting or usernames.

We’ve sent a confirmation to your inbox.
```

**Output**:  
`Hi john.doe@example.com,

```

**Output**:  
`Your subscription will renew on December 31, 2024.`

### `truncate`

Use `truncate` to shorten long content like notification messages.

```liquid

Click here to read more.
```

**Output**:  
`New comment on your post: Great work on your...

## Previewing and testing notification templates

When your notification template is ready, use the **Preview** mode to visualize how your notification will look. You can:

- **Test dynamic payload data:** Provide sample data to see how your template renders with different values.
- **Send test notifications:** Save your template, return to the workflow canvas, and run a test with real trigger data.
