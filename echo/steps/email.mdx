E-mail expected to be an object with the following properties:
- `subject` - The subject of the email
- `body` - The HTML body of the email

Any content generation framework like [React Email](/echo/integrations/react-email) can be used here to generate the HTML Content.

```tsx
await step.email('send-email', async (inputs) => {
  return {
    subject: 'You received a post',
    body: `<html><body>A new post has been created</body></html>`,
  };
});
```
