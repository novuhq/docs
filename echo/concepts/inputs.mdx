title: "Inputs and Payload"
---

Inputs and Payload are defined using [JSON Schema](/echo/recipes/json-schema), providing a strong run-time validation system for your workflows.

This ensures that you as the developer, and your non-technical peers are speaking the same language. Those  responsible for styling and copy can edit with confidence, knowing their changes are tested in code.

- **Step Inputs** - Managed in the Novu Web UI, and are static
- **Payload Schema** - Passed during the `novu.trigger` method, and are dynamic values for each trigger

## Input Schema
[Step](/echo/concepts/steps) input schema is defining the input passed during the `step` method. Those inputs can be modified and persisted in the Novu Web UI.

The snippet below shows configuration for the Workflow payload schema and the Step input schema. If you donâ€™t provide a schema, Typescript will infer the data type to `unknown`, reminding you of the best practice to specify your schema.

```tsx
echo.workflow('new-signup', async ({ step, payload }) => {
    await step.email(
      'send-email',
      async (inputs) => {
          return {
            subject: `Welcome to Acme, ${payload.name}.`,
            body: render(<ReactEmailContent inputs={inputs} />),
        }
      }, {
	      // Learn about JSON Schema here: https://json-schema.org/specification
        inputSchema: {
	        // Always `object`
          type: 'object',
          // Specify the properties to validate. Supports deep nesting.
          properties: {
            hideBanner: { type: 'boolean', default: false },
            complianceFooter: { type: 'string' },
            // Allowing no code control over the component in the Web UI
            components: {
                type: "array",
                items: {
                    type: "string"
                },
                default: ["header", "cta-row", "footer"]
            }
          },
          // Specify the array of which properties are required.
          required: ['complianceFooter'],
          // Used to enforce full type strictness, with no rogue properties.
          additionalProperties: false,
		      // The `as const` is important to let Typescript know that this
		      // type won't change, enabling strong typing on `inputs` via type
		      // inference of the provided JSON Schema.
        } as const,
      });
});
```

    Other validators, including Zod and more, coming soon.
    Any validator that supports transformation to JSON Schema can be added.

### Payload Schema

Payload schema is defining the payload passed during the `novu.trigger` method. This is useful for ensuring that the payload is correctly formatted and that the data is valid.


```tsx
echo.workflow('comment-on-post', async ({ step, payload }) => {
    await step.email(
      'send-email',
      async () => {
          return {
            subject: `Welcome to Acme, ${payload.name}.`,
            body: render(<ReactEmailContent />),
        }
      });
  },
  {
    payloadSchema: {
            // Always `object`
          type: 'object',
          // Specify the properties to validate. Supports deep nesting.
          properties: {
            post_id: { type: 'number', maxLength: 100 },
            comment: { type: 'string', maxLength: 200 },
          },
          // Specify the array of which properties are required.
          required: ['post_id', 'comment'],
          // Used to enforce full type strictness, with no rogue properties.
          additionalProperties: false,
		      // The `as const` is important to let Typescript know that this
		      // type won't change, enabling strong typing on `inputs` via type
		      // inference of the provided JSON Schema.
        } as const,
  },
);
```

Here is an example of the validated payload during trigger:
```tsx
novu.trigger('comment-on-post', {
    to: 'subscriber_id',
    payload: {
        post_id: 1234,
        comment: 'Looks good!'
    }
});
```
