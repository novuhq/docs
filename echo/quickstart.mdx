## Introduction to Echo

Novu Echo SDK allows you to write notification workflows in your codebase. Workflows are functions that execute business logic and use your preferred libraries for email, SMS, and chat generation. You can use Echo with [React.Email](https://react.email/), [MJML](https://mjml.io/), or any other template generator.

## How it Works?

Echo introduces a new paradigm when working with Novu. Rather than to defining workflows and templates at Novu Cloud, Echo enables you to work in your application, use your own libraries and connect to your production environment during workflow execution over HTTPS.

The Echo SDK exports the client, you use to define and serve your workflows and their steps over HTTPS. The workflows can be added to your preferred framework. During workflow execution Novu Cloud makes HTTPS requests to your server during for *just-in-time* Content and Subscribers resolution.
