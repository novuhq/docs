You can also deploy the echo state with our built-in GitHub Action command:

```yaml
name: Deploy Echo State to Novu

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
		  - name: Sync State to Novu
		    uses: novuhq/actions-echo-sync@v0.0.4
		    with:
		      novu-api-key: ${{secrets.NOVU_API_KEY}} # Your Dev or Prod API Key to Novu
		      echo-url: "" # This will be your target environment echo url
```
