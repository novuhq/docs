The notification center is a component, also sometimes referred to as a widget that furnishes your web application with a beautiful and smooth In-App notification experience for users.

In-App notifications are different from push notifications in the sense that In-App notifications are consumed by the user in your app itself, whether push notifications are shown on the device level.

Novu provides a pre-built, ready-to-use and customizable UI component. It also allows you bring your own UI via a headless component which can be used to add In-App notifications to any platform.

4. `notification actions`:- Notification actions are cta buttons below notification content which can be clicked to perform any action or external API call.
