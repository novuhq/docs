The Notification Center Web Component is a custom element that can be used in any web application. It is built by wrapping the React components and consists from its core the three pieces:  `NovuProvider`,  `PopoverNotificationCenter`, and  `NotificationBell` combined together into one.

## ESM module[](https://docs.novu.co/notification-center/web-component#esm-module)

Make sure that you have installed the `@novu/notification-center` package:

```bash
npm install @novu/notification-center

```

Then, import the web component and register it as a custom element:

```tsx
import { NotificationCenterWebComponent } from "@novu/notification-center";

customElements.define(
  "notification-center-component",
  NotificationCenterWebComponent
);
```

After that, you can use the web component in your HTML:

```html
<!-- HTML -->
<notification-center-component
  style="display: inline-flex"
  application-identifier="YOUR_APP_IDENTIFIER"
  subscriber-id="YOUR_SUBSCRIBER_ID"
></notification-center-component>
<script>
  // here you can attach any callbacks, interact with the Notification Center Web Component API
  let nc = document.getElementsByTagName("notification-center-component")[0];
  nc.onLoad = () => console.log("Notification Center session loaded!");
</script>
```

**Please note:** that the properties are named with a `kebab-case` in the HTML, but depending on the technology you use it might be a `camelCase`, for ex. Vue/Angular props are bound with variables using that convention.

## Bundled version (preview)

Sometimes you might not be able to use the ESM module, for example in the WordPress environment. In that case, you can use the bundled version of the Notification Center Web Component that is available on the CDN.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    ...
    <script src="https://novu-web-component.netlify.app/index.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <notification-center-component
      style="display: inline-flex"
      application-identifier="YOUR_APP_IDENTIFIER"
      subscriber-id="YOUR_SUBSCRIBER_ID"
    ></notification-center-component>
    <script>
      // here you can attach any callbacks, interact with the web component API
      let nc = document.getElementsByTagName(
        "notification-center-component"
      )[0];
      nc.onLoad = () => console.log("hello world!");
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Properties

The Notification Center Web Component has a few properties that you can use to customize the behavior of the component. The only required property is `applicationIdentifier`.

If you are using TypeScript, then you might want to check the `NotificationCenterComponentProps` interface.

## Limitations

It's important to note that there are some limitations when using the Web Component compared to the React version:

- You get an all-in-one component
- It doesn't support the `children, header, footer, emptyState, listItem` props
- It's a wrapped react component, which means a bigger bundle size (we are working on it to make it smaller)
