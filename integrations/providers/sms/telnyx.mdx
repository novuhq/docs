You can use the [Telnyx](https://telnyx.com/) provider to send transactional emails to your customers using the Novu Platform with a single API to create multi-channel experiences.

# Getting Started

To use the Telnyx provider in the SMS channel, you will need to create a Telnyx account and add your API key to the Telnyx integration on the Novu platform.

# Finding the API Key

To find your Telnyx API key:

- Log into your Telnyx account.
- Navigate to Account Setting.
- Then go to [Keys & Credentials](https://portal.telnyx.com/#/app/api-keys).
- You can copy the API key from there.
- Alternatively, you can create an API key by tapping on the Create API Key button.

Before copying it, make sure its status is showing active.

# Finding the Message Profile ID

To get your Message profile ID:

- Navigate to [Messaging](https://portal.telnyx.com/#/app/messaging) to find the profiles.
- Make sure you created a Telnyx Messaging Profile previously. Learn more [here](https://developers.telnyx.com/docs/v2/messaging/quickstarts/portal-setup).
- Go to the active Messaging Profile.
- Copy the profile ID.

# Making sure that the From address is valid

A valid from address must be a valid phone number in +E.164 format, a short code, or an alphanumeric sender ID associated with the sending messaging profile. Alphanumeric sender IDs must be between 1 and 11 characters long, and can only contain ASCII letters, numbers, and spaces. They must contain at least one letter.
