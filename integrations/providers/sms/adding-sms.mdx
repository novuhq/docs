  <Step title="Enable SMS channel in Novu Dashboard">

  <Note>
The SMS channel is not enabled by default. To use it, configure a provider like Twilio, Nexmo, or others, and ensure compliance with country-specific restrictions for sender IDs (`from`).
  </Note>

1. Go to the Novu Dashboard and click **"Integrations"** on the left sidebar
2. Click **"Add a provider"**
3. Locate the **SMS** channel and select the provider you want to use and click **"Next"**
4. Select for which environment you want to add the Provider
5. (Optional) Add Conditions to activate the provider only under certain conditions, **useful for tenant-based providers**
6. Click **"Create"**
7. Add your SMS provider credentials:
    - **From**: Displayed as the sender of the SMS (ensure compliance with local regulations)
    - Provider-specific credentials such as API key / Auth token, Account SID, username, or password
8. Save the configuration by clicking **"Update"**


  </Step>

  <Step title="Setup workflow with SMS channel in Novu Dashboard">

    2. Click the **"Add a Workflow"** button.
    3. Add a step and select **"SMS"** as the channel.

        - Message body (e.g., `{{userName}}, your order {{orderId}} has shipped.`).
        - Dynamic placeholders for personalized content.
    5. Optionally, set fallback channels to ensure reliable delivery if SMS fails.

  Some countries have strict restriction of using verified `from` sender id
  (name). Kindly check country and provider specific requirements first.
</Note>

## Sending SMS overrides

The overrides field supports a `sms` property and `from`, `to`, `content` field overrides. This allows you to send a message to a different recipient, from a different sender, or with a different content.

```javascript
import { Novu } from '@novu/node';

const novu = new Novu('<NOVU_SECRET_KEY>');

novu.trigger('<WORKFLOW_TRIGGER_IDENTIFIER>', {
  to: {
    subscriberId: '<SUBSCRIBER_ID>',
  }
  overrides: {
    sms: {
      to: '+123012345678',
      from: 'Novu Team',
      content: 'This SMS message is from overrides'
    },
  },
});
```

## Using different SMS integration

In Novu integration store, multiple SMS channel type provider integrations can be active at the same time. But only one provider integration can be primary at a time. This primary integration will be used as a provider to deliver the SMS by default. If you want to use a different active provider integration then you can use the `integrationIdentifier` sms overrides field.

If there are 4 active SMS integrations with these identifiers:-

1. twilio-abcdef
2. twilio-ghijkl
3. firetext-abcdef
4. infobip-abcdef

Here, if `twilio-abcdef` is primary integration and you want to use `infobip-abcdef` with this trigger then you can use `integrationIdentifier` sms overrides field as below:-

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Node.js">
```javascript
import { Novu } from '@novu/node';

const novu = new Novu('<NOVU_SECRET_KEY>');

novu.trigger('<WORKFLOW_TRIGGER_IDENTIFIER>', {
  to: {
    subscriberId: '<SUBSCRIBER_ID>',
  },
  overrides: {
    sms: {
      integrationIdentifier: 'infobip-abcdef',
    },
  },
});

```
 </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info> Integration identifier is similar to Provider identifier but it is different than Provider Id. It is unique for each integration. You can find the `integrationIdentifier` in the integration store page.  </Info>

## Common errors
