## Channels:

Novu lets you send notifications across different communication mediums, including emails, in-app messages, push notifications, SMS, and chat. Each of these five communication mediums is referred to as a notification ‘channel’.

## Providers:

Providers are what allow us to handle message delivery over multiple channels. Of the five notification channels that Novu currently supports, each channel except the ‘in-app’ channel has multiple providers.

The in-app channel only has one provider (the default Novu provider). 

All the remaining channels have multiple providers.

## Organizations: 
Organizations enable you to segregate notifications across multiple products that you may have. You can use Novu to send notifications across multiple apps and can create organizations.

<Warning>Credentials are saved per instance of the active integrations of a provider. In case of more than one active provider of the same type, If `integrationIdentifier` is not sent in [this](https://docs.novu.co/api-reference/subscribers/update-subscriber-credentials) API, then the most recently created provider will be used to update the credentials.</Warning>
