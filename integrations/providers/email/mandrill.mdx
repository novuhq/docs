You can use the [Mandrill by Mailchimp](https://mandrillapp.com/) provider to send transactional emails to your customers using the Novu Platform with a single API.

# Getting Started

To use the Mandrill provider in the email channel, you will need to create a Mandrill account and add your API key to the Mandrill integration on the Novu platform.

# Generating an API Key

To generate a new API key in Mandrill, you can follow these steps:

- [Sign up](https://login.mailchimp.com/signup/) or [Log in](https://login.mailchimp.com/) to your Mandrill account.
- Navigate to the [Settings](https://mandrillapp.com/settings) of your account and look for the API Keys section at the bottom of the settings page.
- Click on the **+ Add API Key** button to create an API key. Copy the generated key immediately and store it in a secure location. You won’t be able to see or copy the key once you finish generating it.
