You can use the [Outlook 365](https://office.com/) provider to send transactional emails through your instance of Office 365 to your customers using the Novu Platform with a single API.

## Getting Started

To use the Outlook 365 provider in the email channel, you will need to have the sender's email (user) and the password for the account. This account cannot be a shared mailbox or distribution list. It will need to be properly licensed to send email via Office 365.

## Creating the Outlook 365 integration with Novu

- Visit the [Integrations](https://dashboard-v2.novu.co/integrations?utm_campaign=docs-office365) page on Novu.
- Click on Add a Provider.
- Select Outlook service.
- Enter your SMTP credentials
  - `from`: The Complete email address of the sending user. (e.g. [jdoe@mycompany.com](mailto:jdoe@mycompany.com))
  - `senderName`: Sender Name should be the same email address of the sending user. (e.g. [jdoe@mycompany.com](mailto:jdoe@mycompany.com))
  - `password`: Password used to sign in with the email account.
- Click on the `Disabled` button and mark it as `Active`.
- Click on the **Update** button.
- You should now be able to send notifications using Outlook 365 in Novu.
