You can use the [Infobip](https://www.infobip.com/developers/) provider to send transactional emails to your customers using the Novu Platform with a single API to create multi-channel experiences.

# Getting Started

To use the Infobip provider in the email channel, you will need to create an Infobip account and add your API key and Base URL to the Infobip integration on the Novu platform.

# Generating an API Key

To generate a new API key in Infobip, you can follow these steps:

- [Sign up](https://www.infobip.com/signup) or [Log in](https://portal.infobip.com/login/) to your Infobip account.
