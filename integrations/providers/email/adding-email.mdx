2. Click **"Add a provider"**
3. Locate the **Email** channel and select the provider you want to use and click **"Next"**
4. Select for which environment you want to add the Provider
5. (Optional) Add Conditions to activate the provider only under certain conditions, **useful for tenant-based providers**
6. Click **"Create"**
7. Add your Email provider credentials:
    - **From**: Displayed as the sender of the email (ensure compliance with local regulations)
    - **Sender Name**: The name that will be used to send the email
    - Provider-specific credentials such as API key / Auth token, Account SID, username, or password
