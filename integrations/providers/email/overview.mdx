import { MissingProvider } from "/snippets/missing-provider.mdx";

Novu can be used to deliver email messages to your customers using a unified delivery API. You can easily integrate your favorite email provider using the built-in integration store.

## Configuring email providers

When creating an email provider integration you will be asked to provide additional fields alongside the provider-specific credentials:

- **Sender name** - Will be displayed as the sender of the message
- **From email address** - Emails sent using Novu will be sent using this address

For some email providers including SendGrid you will have to authenticate the **From email address** to make sure you will send email messages using an authorized address.

## Sending Email Overrides

The overrides field supports an email property. The email overrides field have properties like `to`, `from`, `senderName` etc

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Node.js">
```javascript
import { Novu } from '@novu/node';

const novu = new Novu('<NOVU_API_KEY>');

novu.trigger('<WORKFLOW_TRIGGER_IDENTIFIER>', {
  to: {
    subscriberId: '<SUBSCRIBER_ID>',
  },
  overrides: {
    email: {
      to: ['to@novu.co'],
      from: 'from@novu.co',
      senderName: 'Novu Team',
      text: 'text version of email using overrides',
      replyTo: 'no-reply@novu.co',
      cc: ['1@novu.co'],
      bcc: ['2@novu.co'],
    },
  },
});
````
 </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>It's very important to know that Novu merges the `to` field in the email overrides with the subscriber email. It DOES NOT REPLACE IT.</Note>

## Sending Email attachments

You can easily send attachments with the Novu API by passing the attachments array when triggering an Email based workflow. Attachment file can either be in the `buffer` or `base64` format.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Node.js">

```javascript
import { Novu } from '@novu/node';

const novu = new Novu('<NOVU_API_KEY>');

novu.trigger('<WORKFLOW_TRIGGER_IDENTIFIER>', {
  to: {
    subscriberId: '<SUBSCRIBER_ID>',
  },
  payload: {
    attachments: [
      {
        file: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/data/novu.jpeg'),
        name: 'novu.jpeg',
        mime: 'image/jpeg',
      },
    ],
  },
});
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Using different email integration

In Novu integration store, multiple email channel type provider integrations can be active at the same time. But only one provider integration can be primary at a time. This primary integration will be used as a provider to deliver the email by default. If you want to use a different active provider integration then you can use the `integrationIdentifier` email overrides field.

If there are 4 active email integrations with these identifiers:-

1. sendgrid-abcdef
2. sendgrid-ghijkl
3. brevo-abcdef
4. mailersend-abcdef

Here, if `sendgrid-abcdef` is primary integration and you want to use `brevo-abcdef` with this trigger then you can use `integrationIdentifier` email overrides field as below:-

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Node.js">
```javascript
import { Novu } from '@novu/node';

const novu = new Novu('<NOVU_API_KEY>');

novu.trigger('<WORKFLOW_TRIGGER_IDENTIFIER>', {
  to: {
    subscriberId: '<SUBSCRIBER_ID>',
  },
  overrides: {
    email: {
      integrationIdentifier: "brevo-abcdef"
    },
  },
});
```
 </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info> Integration identifier is similar to Provider identifier but it is different than Provider Id. It is unique for each integration.You can find the `integrationIdentifier` in the integration store page.  </Info>
