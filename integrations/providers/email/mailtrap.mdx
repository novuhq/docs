You can use the [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/email-sending/) provider to send transactional emails to your customers using the Novu Platform with a single API to create multi-channel experiences.

# Getting Started

To use the Mailtrap provider in the email channel, you will need to create a Mailtrap account and add your API key to the Mailtrap integration on the Novu platform.

# Generating an API Key

To generate a new API key in Mailtrap, you can follow these steps:

- [Sign Up](https://mailtrap.io/register/signup) or [Log in](https://mailtrap.io/signin) to your Mailtrap account.
- Click on the **Email Sending** link on the sidebar, and then click the "Sending Domains" link that pops up from the available options.
- On the [Sending Domains](https://mailtrap.io/sending/domains) page, type your domain name and confirm with the `Add Your Domain` button. Then, proceed to copy DNS records Mailtrap provides to your domain’s DNS.
- Go to [API Keys](https://mailtrap.io/api-tokens) page and copy token with `Domain Admin` access level for your registered domain.

# Authenticating your Sender Identity

Before you can send emails, you will need to [verify your sending domain ownership](https://help.mailtrap.io/article/69-sending-domain-setup). Mailtrap rejects sending emails from unverified domains to prevent spam and email fraud.

# Creating a Mailtrap integration with Novu

- Visit the [Integrations store](https://dashboard-v2.novu.co/integrations?utm_campaign=docs-mailtrap) on the Novu web dashboard.
- Click on Add a Provider.
- Select Mailtrap service.
- Enter your Mailtrap API Key.
- Fill in the `From email address` field using the authenticated email from the previous step.
- Click on the `Disabled` button and mark it as `Active`.
- Click on the **Update** button.
- You should now be able to send notifications through Mailtrap using Novu.
