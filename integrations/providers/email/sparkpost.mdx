You can use the [SparkPost](https://messagebird.com/email/cloud-sending) provider to send transactional emails to your customers using the Novu Platform with a single API.

# Getting Started

To use the SparkPost provider in the email channel, you will need to create a SparkPost account and add your API key to the SparkPost integration on the Novu platform.

# Generating an API Key

To generate a new API key in SparkPost, you can follow these steps:

- [Sign up](https://app.sparkpost.com/join) or [Log in](https://app.sparkpost.com/auth) to your SparkPost account.
  > During sign up, note that SparkPost is available in multiple regions. "SparkPost" refers to the SparkPost service hosted in North America. "SparkPost EU" refers to the SparkPost service hosted in Western Europe. An account created with SparkPost cannot be used with SparkPost EU, and vice-versa. You may use accounts in both regions.

- Click on the **Configuration** link on the navbar, and then click the "API Keys" link that pops up from the available options.

# Authenticating your Sender Identity

Before you can send emails on a large scale, you will need to authenticate your Sender Identity.

SparkPost allows you to authenticate your sender identity using [Sending Domains](https://app.sparkpost.com/domains/list/sending).

- Click on Add a Provider.
- Select SparkPost service.
- Enter your SparkPost API Key.
- Fill in the `From email address` field using the authenticated email from the previous step.
- Fill in the `Sender's name`.
- Toggle the `eu` switch to true if you're in Western Europe
- Click on the `Disabled` button and mark it as `Active`.
