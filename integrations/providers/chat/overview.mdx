## Configuring chat providers

To configure a chat provider, you need to add a new integration to your Novu account. You can do this by navigating to the integration store and clicking on the **Add a provider** button and then select the chat provider you want to configure. You can find the [integration store](https://dashboard.novu.co/integrations?utm_campaign=docs-chat-overview) in the left sidebar of the Novu dashboard.

Each chat provider requires defferent type of credentials. There are few providers which does not require any credentials example: `Discord`

## Sending chat message

Steps to send a chat message using Novu:-

1. Add a chat provider integration to your Novu account from the integration store. Enter credentials if required and save the integration. Follow corresponding provider documentation to get the required credentials.
2. Create a new subscriber

> Step 2 can be skipped if you already have a subscriber. You can use the `subscriberId` of an existing subscriber.

3. [Update](/channels-and-providers/chat/overview#update-credential-webhookurl) the subscriber credential `webhookUrl` for this provider and integration.

4. Create a new [worklow](/workflows/notification-workflows) or use an existing workflow. Add chat channel and [write content](/content-creation-design/notification-content-creation#chat) for the message.

5. Trigger this workflow to above `subscriberId` using trigger identifier

6. Check the chat provider if message is received. If not, check the logs in [activity feed](/activity-feed/introduction) for for any errors.

## Common errors

Common erros and reason of those errors while sending chat messages using Novu.

1. Subscriber does not have a configured channel.
   - if the subscriber does not have credentials set up for any of the chat provider.
2. Webhook URL for the chat channel is missing.
