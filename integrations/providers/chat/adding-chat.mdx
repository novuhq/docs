    <Warning> Each chat provider requires defferent type of credentials. There are few providers which does not require any credentials example: `Discord` </Warning>

## Sending chat message

Steps to send a chat message using Novu:-

1. Add a chat provider integration to your Novu account from the integration store. Enter credentials if required and save the integration. Follow corresponding provider documentation to get the required credentials.
2. Create a new subscriber

> Step 2 can be skipped if you already have a subscriber. You can use the `subscriberId` of an existing subscriber.

3. [Update](/integrations/providers/chat/overview#update-credential-webhookurl) the subscriber credential `webhookUrl` for this provider and integration.

4. Create a new [worklow](/workflow/overview) or use an existing workflow. Add chat channel and [write content](/content-creation-design/notification-content-creation#chat) for the message.

5. Trigger this workflow to above `subscriberId` using trigger identifier

6. Check the chat provider if message is received.

## Update credential webhookUrl

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Node.js">
```javaScript
import {
  Novu,
  ChatProviderIdEnum
} from '@novu/node';

const novu = new Novu("<NOVU_SECRET_KEY>");

await novu.subscribers.setCredentials('subscriberId', ChatProviderIdEnum.Slack, {
webhookUrl: "<WEBHOOK_URL>",
});

```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="cURL">
```bash
curl -L -X PUT 'https://api.novu.co/v1/subscribers/<SUBSCRIBER_ID>/credentials' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: ApiKey <NOVU_SECRET_KEY>' \
-d '{
  "providerId": "slack",
  "credentials": {
      "webhookUrl": "<WEBHOOK_URL>"
  },
  "integrationIdentifier": "slack-MnGLxp8uy"
}'
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Checkout the [API reference](/api-reference/subscribers/update-subscriber-credentials) for more details.

<Info>
  {" "}
  Integration identifier is similar to Provider identifier but it is different than
  Provider Id. It is unique for each integration. You can find the `integrationIdentifier`
  in the integration store page.{" "}
</Info>

## Common errors

Common erros and reason of those errors while sending chat messages using Novu.

1. Subscriber does not have a configured channel.
   - if the subscriber does not have credentials set up for any of the chat provider.
2. Webhook URL for the chat channel is missing.
   - `webhookUrl` field is null, undefined or not set. Check using [get subscriber api](/api-reference/subscribers/get-subscriber).
3. Subscriber does not have an active integration.
   - if subscriber have credentials set but integration is either not active or deleted for this credential.
