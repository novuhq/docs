[OneSignal](https://onesignal.com/) is a paid push notification service that supports sending messages via both [Apple Push Notification Service](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server) (APNs) as well as [Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging) (FCM).

To configure the OneSignal integration, you will need an active account which has credentials for APNs, FCM or both, and have access to the `OneSignal App ID` and `Rest API Key` available via your [application's settings page](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/keys-and-ids).

## Setting the Device Token

Once OneSignal has been configured with your credentials for APNs/FCM, and the OneSignal SDK has been [set up and configured](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/onboarding-with-onesignal#step-1-setup-onesignal-sdk) for your application, your users will begin to be automatically assigned a unique OneSignal [player_id](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/users#player-id) identifier by the SDK.

This identifier allows targeting your user when sending push notifications without having to retrieve the specific Android or iOS device tokens - which are managed by OneSignal.

In order to target the OneSignal user from Novu, you must register the OneSignal `player_id`as the `deviceToken` for your Novu subscriber. This value can be retrieved via the [OneSignal SDK](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/users-and-devices#finding-users) for your platform.

Once you have the user's `player_id` value, the `deviceToken` for your Novu subscriber can be set via:

```javaScript
import {
  Novu,

} from '@novu/node';

const novu = new Novu("<NOVU_SECRET_KEY>");

await novu.subscribers.setCredentials('subscriberId', PushProviderIdEnum.OneSignal, {
  // Your user's unique 'player_id' from OneSignal
  deviceTokens: [ 'ad0452ca-3ca7-43b5-bf9b-fa93fd322035' ],
});

## SDK Trigger Example

```typescript
novu.trigger("<WORKFLOW_TRIGGER_IDENTIFIER>", {
  to: {
    subscriberId: "<SUBSCRIBER_ID>",
  },
  payload: {
    abc: "def", // If the notification is a data notification, the payload will be sent as the data
  },
  overrides: {
    subtitle: "This is subtitle value",
    mutableContent: "Mutable content value",
    // for android notification categories
    channelId: "category_id",
    // for ios notification categories
    categoryId: "Category id",
    // same value is used for all sizes and browsers
    icon: "https://image.com/icon.png",
    // used for both android and ios
    sound: "sound file url"
  }
});
```
    
Device/notification identifiers can be set by using [setCredentials](/integrations/providers/push/fcm#setting-device-token)

## Using external user id

By default, Novu uses player id to send notifications, `External ID` option can be selected in the onesignal integration settings. If `External ID` option is selected, `deviceTokens` stored in subscriber credentials for onesignal provider, will be used as external user ids.
