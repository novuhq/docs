## Better together
Novu Project is where the community comes together with our development teams to improve notifications for everyone. Novu Cloud is our commercial offering, and where we extend the capabilities of the Novu Project and make them accessible and consumable by all teams and businesses. Most simply, the Novu Project is how you test and experiment with notifications infrastructure, and Novu Cloud is how you press the easy button for all things notifications.

### Key differences
Our goal is always provide a functional, powerful, and complete notifications infrastructure platform, whether you opt to self host or use our cloud offering. However, certain features we build into Novu Cloud are not available in the Novu Project. When this happens, it's for several reasons:
- We rely on a paid third-party service provider
- The feature is complex and requires significant investment (read: money!) time to build and maintain
- The feature is primarily targeted at the largest and most sophisticated of use cases, and supporting these in self-hosted environments is challenging

### Unmatched flexbility
One huge advantage of working with Novu? If you opt for a paid Novu Cloud account, you can always fall back to the free tier, or migrate your notifications to a self-hosted Novu Project instance. Say goodbye to notifications risk.
