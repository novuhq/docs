Docker compose is the easiest way to get started with self-hosted Novu.

## Before you begin

You need the following installed in your system:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

  width="100%"
  height="400px"
  frameBorder="0"
  allowFullScreen
></iframe>

<Info>
  In above loom video `local/deployment` directory is used. Now it has been
  moved to `docker/community`. Follow below mentioned steps.
</Info>

## Quick Start

### Get the code

Clone the Novu repo and enter the docker directory:

```bash
# Get the code
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/novuhq/novu

# Go to the docker community folder
cd novu/docker/community

# Copy the example env file
cp .env.example .env
```

### Configure Environment

#### Local Development
For local development, you can use the default configuration. Start Novu with:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```

Now visit [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200/) to start using Novu.

#### VPS Deployment
When deploying to a VPS, update your `.env` file with your server's information:

```bash
# Replace <vps-ip-address> with your VPS IP address
HOST_NAME=http://<vps-ip-address>
```

Start Novu on your VPS:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```

Access your dashboard at [http://vps-ip-address:4200](http://vps-ip-address:4200/).

## Securing your setup

While we provide example secrets for getting started, you should NEVER deploy your Novu setup using the defaults provided.

Update the `.env` file with your own secrets.

### Required Variables:

- `JWT_SECRET`: Used by the API to generate JWT keys.
- `STORE_ENCRYPTION_KEY`: Used to encrypt/decrypt the provider credentials. It must be 32 characters long.
- `HOST_NAME`: Host name of your installation:
  - For local development: `http://localhost`
  - For VPS deployment: Your server's IP address (e.g., `http://<vps-ip-address>`) or domain name
- `REDIS_CACHE_SERVICE_HOST` and `REDIS_HOST` can have same value for small deployments. For larger deployments, it is recommended to use separate Redis instances for caching and queue management.

## Configuration

To keep the setup simple, we made some choices that may not be optimal for production:

- the database is in the same machine as the servers
- the storage uses localstack instead of S3

We strongly recommend that you decouple your database before deploying.

### Setting Up Novu Studio and Bridge

#### Setting Up Novu Studio
Novu Studio is a development environment that allows you to test and manage your notifications. The setup varies based on your deployment:

##### For Local Development
```bash
npx novu@latest dev
```

##### For VPS Deployment
```bash
# Start Novu Studio with your VPS dashboard URL and bridge application URL
npx novu@latest dev -d http://<vps-ip-address>:4200 -o http://<novu-bridge-ip>:4000
```

#### Setting Up the Novu Bridge
The Novu Bridge is used to connect your application with Novu. Here's how to set it up:

```bash
# Initialize the bridge
npx novu@latest init \
  --secret-key=<secret> \
  --api-url=http://<vps-ip-address>:3000

# Start the bridge
npm run dev
```

### Synchronizing Workflows

For VPS deployment:
```bash
npx novu@latest sync \
  --bridge-url http://<novu-bridge-ip>:3000/api/novu \
  --api-url http://<vps-ip-address>:3000 \
  --secret-key <secret>
```

### VPS Security Considerations

When deploying to a VPS, consider these additional security measures:

1. Use a firewall to restrict access to only necessary ports
2. Set up SSL/TLS certificates for HTTPS access
3. Regularly update your Docker images and host system
4. Use strong, unique secrets in your `.env` file
5. Consider using a reverse proxy like Nginx for additional security layers

### Triggering events with custom installation

When self-hosting Novu, in order to trigger an event you must first create a new `Novu` object and configure it with the proper `backendUrl`.

```tsx
import { Novu } from "@novu/node";

const config = {
  backendUrl: "<REPLACE_WITH_BACKEND_URL>",
};

const novu = new Novu("<API_KEY>", config);

await novu.trigger("<WORKFLOW_TRIGGER_IDENTIFIER>", {
  to: {
    subscriberId: "<SUBSCRIBER_ID>",
  },
  payload: {},
});
```

### Pointing IFrame embed to custom installation

When using the IFrame embed to attach the notification center rather than the React component, you need to specify the `backendUrl` and the `socketUrl` when initializing the iframe.

```html
<script>
  novu.init(
    "<REPLACE_APPLICATION_ID>",
    {
      unseenBadgeSelector: "#unseen-badge",
      bellSelector: "#notification-bell",
      backendUrl: "https://api.example.com",
      socketUrl: "https://ws.example.com",
    },
    {}
  );
</script>
```

### Using React Component with custom installation

See [Use your own backend and socket URL](https://v0.x-docs.novu.co/notification-center/client/react/get-started#use-your-own-backend-and-socket-url).

### Caching

We are introducing the first stage of caching in our system to improve performance and efficiency. Caching is turned off by default, but can easily be activated by setting the following environment variables:

- REDIS_CACHE_SERVICE_HOST
- REDIS_CACHE_SERVICE_PORT

Currently, we are caching data in the most heavily loaded areas of the system: the widget requests such as feed and unseen count, as well as common DAL requests during the execution of trigger event flow. These are the most heavily used areas of our system, and we hope that by implementing caching in these areas, we can improve performance in the near future.

### Reverse-Proxy / Load Balancers

To implement a reverse-proxy or load balancer in front of Novu, you need to set the GLOBAL_CONTEXT_PATH for the base path of the application.
This is the path that the application will be served from after the domain.
For example: - company.com/novu
This is used to set the base path for the application, and is used to set the base path for the API, web, and websocket connections.

The following environment variables are used to set the context path for each public service that Novu provides:
API_CONTEXT_PATH
WIDGET_CONTEXT_PATH
WS_CONTEXT_PATH
WEB_CONTEXT_PATH

These allow you to set the context path for each service independently or dependently of the GLOBAL_CONTEXT_PATH.

For example, if I was using a reverse proxy to serve Novu from company.com/novu,
I would set the GLOBAL_CONTEXT_PATH to novu,
and then set the API_CONTEXT_PATH to api,
the WIDGET_CONTEXT_PATH to widget,
the WS_CONTEXT_PATH to ws,
and the WEB_CONTEXT_PATH to web.

This would produce the following urls: - API: company.com/novu/api - WIDGET: company.com/novu/widget - WS: company.com/novu/ws - WEB: company.com/novu/web

However the Service context path can be used entirely independently of the GLOBAL_CONTEXT_PATH.

For example, if I wanted to expose the api as novu-api, I would set the API_CONTEXT_PATH to novu-api without setting the GLOBAL_CONTEXT_PATH.
This would producte the following url: - API: company.com/novu-api

<Note>
  {" "}
  These env variables should be present on all services novu provides due to tight
  coupling.
</Note>

## FAQs

### Local Tunnel and Self-Hosted Deployments

Novu uses a local tunnel to connect to Local Studio during development. Local tunnel support is not included as part of the Novu Docker images. This is typically unnecessary for many users, depending on how their environment is structured.

#### When is Local Tunnel Not Required?
If the customer's application and the self-hosted Novu deployment are within the same network, there is no need for a local tunnel. In this case, the application can communicate directly with Novu through the internal network.

#### When is Local Tunnel Required?
If the application and Novu deployment reside on different networks, you can still interact with your self-hosted Novu instance using the Novu CLI. The CLI allows you to specify the Dashboard URL and Bridge Endpoint Origin to enable communication across networks via the Novu Cloud Local Tunnel.

For example, you can use the following command:

```bash
npx novu@latest dev -d http://my-self-hosted-novu-domain.com:my-port -o http://my-app-running-novu-domain.com
```

- `-d`: The URL of your self-hosted Novu Dashboard.
- `-o`: The origin of your application that will be communicating with Novu.

For more details on the available options, refer to the CLI help by running:

```bash
npx novu@latest dev --help
```
