Explore the code for [this quickstart on GitHub](https://github.com/novuhq/redwoodjs-quickstart/).

Explore the [live demo](https://novu-redwoodjs-blog.netlify.app/contact).

## Prerequisites

To follow the steps in this quickstart, you'll need:

- A Novu account. If you don't have one, [sign up for free](https://web.novu.co).
- Node.js installed on your development machine.

## Create a RedwoodJS app

Clone the popular RedwoodJS blog tutorial app by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood-tutorial
cd redwood-tutorial
yarn install
yarn rw prisma migrate dev
yarn rw prisma db seed
yarn rw dev
```

## Install Novu

To install Novu's In-App notification center, simply issue the following command:

```bash
yarn workspace web add @novu/notification-center
```

Next, install Novu's Node SDK to fire notifications from the api/backend:

```bash
yarn workspace api add @novu/node
```

# Register The Notification Center Component

Head over to `web/src/layouts/BlogLayout/BlogLayout.js` file of the recently cloned project and add the Novu In-App Notification center.

The file should look like this:

```js
import {
  NovuProvider,
  PopoverNotificationCenter,
  NotificationBell,
} from "@novu/notification-center";

import { Link, routes } from "@redwoodjs/router";

import { useAuth } from "src/auth";

const BlogLayout = ({ children }) => {
  const { logOut, isAuthenticated, currentUser } = useAuth();
  const SUBSCRIBER_ID = process.env.REDWOOD_ENV_SUBSCRIBER_ID;
  const APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER = process.env.REDWOOD_ENV_APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER;

  return (
    <>
      <header className="relative flex justify-between items-center py-4 px-8 bg-blue-700 text-white">
        <h1 className="text-5xl font-semibold tracking-tight">
          <Link
            className="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-100 transition duration-100"
            to={routes.home()}
          >
            Redwood Blog with <em>Novu</em>
          </Link>
        </h1>
        <nav>
          <ul className="relative flex items-center font-light">
            <li>
              <NovuProvider
                subscriberId={SUBSCRIBER_ID}
                applicationIdentifier={APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER}
              >
                <PopoverNotificationCenter
                  showUserPreferences={true}
                  position="top-start"
                >
                  {({ unseenCount }) => (
                    <NotificationBell unseenCount={unseenCount} />
                  )}
                </PopoverNotificationCenter>
              </NovuProvider>
            </li>
            <li>
              <Link
                className="py-2 px-4 hover:bg-blue-600 transition duration-100 rounded"
                to={routes.about()}
              >
                About
              </Link>
            </li>
            <li>
              <Link
                className="py-2 px-4 hover:bg-blue-600 transition duration-100 rounded"
                to={routes.contact()}
              >
                Contact
              </Link>
            </li>
            <li>
              {isAuthenticated ? (
                <div>
                  <button type="button" onClick={logOut} className="py-2 px-4">
                    Logout
                  </button>
                </div>
              ) : (
                <Link to={routes.login()} className="py-2 px-4">
                  Login
                </Link>
              )}
            </li>
          </ul>
          {isAuthenticated && (
            <div className="absolute bottom-1 right-0 mr-12 text-xs text-blue-300">
              {currentUser.email}
            </div>
          )}
        </nav>
      </header>
      <main className="max-w-4xl mx-auto p-12 bg-white shadow rounded-b">
        {children}
      </main>
    </>
  );
};

export default BlogLayout;
```

<Note>
  Add `REDWOOD_ENV_APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER` and `REDWOOD_ENV_SUBSCRIBER_ID` to
  the `.env` file.{" "}
</Note>

The `Subscriber ID` ideally should be the `id` of the **logged in user**. When a user logs into your app, they’ll be able to see all their notifications in the notification center. For this to work successfully, the user should have been created as a subscriber on Novu.

The `Application Identifier` is a public key used to identify your application.

Head over to your [Novu dashboard settings](https://web.novu.co/settings), copy the application identifier and add it as the value of `REDWOOD_ENV_APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER`.

Head over to [the Subscribers page](https://web.novu.co/subscribers), grab a subscriber identifier and add it as the value of `REDWOOD_ENV_SUBSCRIBER_ID` in the `.env` file.

Now, check your app, you will see a notification bell button. Click on the button to reveal the notification center UI. Voila!

<Note>
  There are no notifications because none has been triggered yet. When
  notifications are sent to a subscriber, it will show up in the UI. Next, we'll
  learn how to trigger notifications.
</Note>

## Create A Workflow

The first step to trigger notifications is to create a workflow. A workflow is like a map that holds the entire flow of messages sent to the subscriber.

<Note>The recipients of a triggered notification are called subscribers.</Note>

The workflow includes the following:

- Workflow name and Identifier
- Channel tailored content:

| Channel | Content Style                                                                                 |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Email   | 1. Custom Code (HTML) with option to use custom variables via the handlebars , {{ }}, syntax. |
|         | 2. Click and place UI items with the visual template editor.                                  |
| SMS     | Text with the option to use handlebars syntax, {{ }} to inject custom variables.              |
| Chat    | Text with the option to use handlebars syntax, {{ }} to inject custom variables.              |
| In-App  | Text                                                                                          |

Please proceed to create a workflow.

1. Click **Workflows** on the left sidebar of your Novu dashboard.
2. Click the **Add a workflow** button on the top left.
3. The name of the new workflow is currently "Untitled." Rename it to a more suitable title.
4. Select **In-App** as the channel you want to add.
5. Click on the recently added In-App channel and configure it.

<Frame caption="Configure it as per your requirements and then save it">
  <img src="/images/configure-in-app-vue.png" />{" "}
</Frame>
I’ll briefly explain the function of each label in the image above.

- **1-Preview**: Shows you a glimpse of how each notification item will look like in the Notification Center UI.
- **2-Avatar:** If turned on, each notification item will show the avatar of the subscriber.
- **3-Action:** With this, you can add a primary and secondary call to action button to each notification item.
- **4-Notification Feeds:** This displays a stream of specific notifications. You can have multiple feeds to show specific notifications in multiple tabs.
- **5-Redirect URL** - This is the URL to which a subscriber can be directed when they click on a notification item.
- **6-Filter** - This feature allows you to configure the criteria for delivering notifications. For instance, you can apply a filter based on a subscriber's online status to send them an email if they were online within the last hour. Read [more about filters](https://docs.novu.co/platform/step-filter/#subscriber-seen--read-filters).

In the In-App channel `Editor`, add the following content and rename the step to `Onboarding In App` :

```js
Hi {{ name }},
<br/>
<p>Thanks for indicating interest in attending RedwoodJS conference. Here is your message: </p>

<p>{{ message }}</p>
```

<Note>
  {" "}
  `{{ name }}` and `{{ message }}` are payload values that will be passed on from
  our code to the workflow template so it can appear in the notification sent to
  subscribers.
</Note>

Click on the `Update` button to save the configuration successfully!

6. In the workflow page, drag and drop the **Email** channel to the workflow canvas to be just below the `In-App` channel.
7. Click on the recently added Email channel and configure it:

Add `Sender name` and `Subject`. Ensure the `Default Layout` is selected for the Email Layout.

Switch to the `Custom Code` section and add the following:

```js
Hi {{ name }},

<br />
<p>Thank you for attending RedwoodJS Conference. This means a lot to us!</p>
<br />
<p>Here is your message:</p>

{{ message }}
```

Finally, give the workflow a name. We'll need the workflow trigger identifier **_(which is the slug of the name)_** later.

Next, we’ll learn how to trigger notifications to subscribers.

## Trigger A Notification

Open up `api/src/services/contacts/contacts.js`, and add the following code into your app to trigger a notification:

```js
import { Novu } from '@novu/node'

const novu = new Novu(process.env.NOVU_API_KEY)

export async function sendNotification(email, name, message) {
  await novu.trigger('<workflow-trigger-id>', {
    to: {
      subscriberId: process.env.REDWOOD_ENV_SUBSCRIBER_ID,
      email: email,
    },
    payload: {
      name: name,
      message: message,
    },
  })
}

...

...

/** In the createContact code, call the sendNotification and pass in the email, name and message */
export const createContact = ({ input }) => {
  validate(input.email, 'email', { email: true })

  sendNotification(input.email, input.name, input.message)

  return db.contact.create({
    data: input,
  })
}

...
...
```

Before running the code, make sure you understand the following:

- The value of `<workflow-trigger-id>` should be the workflow’s trigger ID/slug.
- The value of `payload` is an array of the data that you want to be dynamically injected into the workflow content.
- The value of `subscriberId` is the id of the subscriber on Novu.
- Ensure `NOVU_API_KEY` is in the `.env` file and with the appropriate value gotten from the dashboard.

## One more thing

Head over to the [integrations store on your Novu dashboard](https://web.novu.co/integrations).

Select the **Novu Email Test Provider**, and mark as the primary provider for Emails. This ensures that all emails are sent via the Novu Email provider.

## Test the app

Ensure your app is still running and head over the `/contact` page in the app. Fill the form and click `Save`.

The app will trigger two notifications:

- An In-App notification
- An Email notification

## Conclusion

Great job! If you've reached this point, you should now have successfully created workflow, configured a channel provider, triggered a workflow, and sent an email and In-App notification.
