Learn how to integrate Novu into your Ruby project on the fly and send notifications across different channels (SMS, Email, Chat, Push).

Let's get started! ðŸ’ª

# Requirements

To follow the steps in this quickstart, you'll need:

- A Novu account.Â [Sign up for free](http://web.novu.co/)Â if you donâ€™t have one yet.
- A working Ruby development environment with at least version 2.6.0.

You can alsoÂ [view the completed code](https://github.com/novuhq/novu-ruby-quickstart)Â of this quick start in a GitHub repo.

# Install Novu Ruby SDK

TheÂ [Ruby SDK](http://github.com/novuhq/novu-ruby)Â provides a fluent and expressive interface for interacting with Novu's API and managing notifications.

You can install the client library via RubyGems:

```ruby
gem install novu

```

Or add it to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'novu'

```

Then runÂ `bundle install`.

# Initialize & Configure the Novu Ruby SDK

To use the library, Create a new fileÂ `index.rb`Â then initialize the client with your API token:

```ruby
require 'novu'

client = Novu::Client.new('YOUR_NOVU_API_KEY')

```

Replace theÂ `YOUR_NOVU_API_KEY`Â argument with the authentic key from theÂ **API Key**Â section of yourÂ [Novu Dashboard](https://web.novu.co/settings).

<Note>
  Please do not hardcode your credentials in a file in production. Use
  environment variables instead.
</Note>

To test your API key, call the methods on the client to interact with the Novu API and display the result on your ruby console:

```ruby
puts client.notifications

```

Run the fileÂ `index.rb`:

```bash
ruby index.rb

```

You should see a result as below:

```json
{
  "page": 0,
  "totalCount": 0,
  "pageSize": 10,
  "data": []
}
```

# Set Up A Channel Provider

A channel provider is a service that provides one or more notification functionality such as sending an email, SMS, push notification etc. OurÂ [integration store](https://web.novu.co/integrations)Â includes four channels: Email, SMS, Chat, and Push. These channels have multiple providers associated with them.

| Channel | Providers                                                           |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Email   | MailGun, Mandrill, MailJet, Amazon SES, Sendgrid, Postmark, Netcore |
| SMS     | Twilio, Amazon SNS, Plivo, SMS, SMSCentral, Kannel, Infobip, Termii |
| Chat    | Mattermost, Slack, Microsoft Teams, Discord                         |
| Push    | FCM, APNS, Expo                                                     |

Only one provider can beÂ **active**Â perÂ **channel**. Connect any of your favorite providers to get started. The email channel comes with Novu's email provider, which is active by default and includes 300 credits.

# Create A Workflow

A workflow is a blueprint for the notifications that will be sent. It holds the entire flow of messages sent to the subscriber. This is where all the different channels are tied together under a single entity.

The workflow includes the following:

- Workflow name and Identifier
- Channel-tailored content:

| Channel | Content Style                                                                                    |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Email   | 1. Custom Code (HTML) with the option to use custom variables via the handlebars, {{ }}, syntax. |
|         | 2. Click and place UI items with the visual template editor.                                     |
| SMS     | Text with the option to use handlebars syntax, {{ }} to inject custom variables.                 |
| Chat    | Text with the option to use handlebars syntax, {{ }} to inject custom variables.                 |
| In-App  | Text                                                                                             |

<Note>
  Proper authorization needs to be set for the Chat channel for subscribers.
</Note>

Please proceed to create a workflow.

1. ClickÂ **Workflows**Â on the left sidebar of your Novu dashboard.
2. Click theÂ **Create Workflow**Â button on the top right.
   <Frame caption="Use the create workflow button to create a workflow">
     <img src="/images/workflow-kotlin.png" />{" "}
   </Frame>
3. The name of the new workflow is currentlyÂ Untitled, rename it to a more suitable title.
   <Frame caption="Rename the workflow to a more suitable title">
     <img src="/images/renam-workflow-kotlin.png" />{" "}
   </Frame>
4. SelectÂ EmailÂ as the channel you want to add, by dragging it from the right sidebar.
   <Frame caption="SelectÂ EmailÂ as the channel you want to add, by dragging it from the right sidebar.">
     <img src="/images/select-email-kotlin.png" />{" "}
   </Frame>
5. Click on theÂ EmailÂ in the workflow and edit it as per this image. Donâ€™t forget to add the fields in the editor which is supposed to be updated with dynamic values that will be sent when calling the API.
   <Frame caption="Add the fields in the email editor">
     <img src="/images/add-fields-kotlin.png" />{" "}
   </Frame>
6. Also, add the variables in theÂ VariablesÂ section in the test tab and try testing it by sending the email to your email address using theÂ Send Test EmailÂ button at the bottom right.
   <Frame caption="Add the variables in theÂ VariablesÂ section in the test tab">
     <img src="/images/add-variables-kotlin.png" />{" "}
   </Frame>
   You should get an email within seconds! ðŸ‘Œ

Great, you have successfully sent your first notification via the Novu dashboard! Now, letâ€™s take a step further to trigger notifications via code.

## Create A Subscriber

The recipients of a triggered notification are called subscribers.

ClickÂ **Subscribers**Â on the left sidebar of the Novu dashboard to see all subscribers. By default, the dashboard will display a subscriber, as you were added automatically during sign-up.

<Frame caption="By default, the dashboard will display a subscriber, as you were added automatically during sign-up.">
  <img src="/images/default-sub-kotlin.png" />{" "}
</Frame>
Now, let's create a subscriber on Novu. Copy and paste the following code to do so:
```ruby require 'novu'

client = Novu::Client.new('YOUR_NOVU_API_KEY')

# Create subscriber

create_payload = {
'subscriberId' => '7789', # replace with system_internal_user_id
'firstName' => 'John', # optional
'lastName' => 'Doe', # optional
}
client.create_subscriber(create_payload)

````

Run the code in your terminal:

```bash
ruby index.rb

````

You should see the subscriber on your Novu dashboard.

Iâ€™d like to publicly announce thatÂ `abc@gmail.com`Â is a random unlikely email your users will have. To update this to an alternative email, you can call theÂ `updateSubscriber`Â method like so:

```ruby
require 'novu'

client = Novu::Client.new('YOUR_NOVU_API_KEY')

## Update subscriber detail

update_payload = {
    'email' => 'validemail@gmail.com',  # replace with valid email
    'firstName' => '<insert-firstname>', # optional
    'lastName' => 'Obasanjo', # optional
}
client.update_subscriber('7789', update_payload);

```

Other valid fields that can be updated areÂ `phone`,Â `avatar`, andÂ `data`. TheÂ `data`Â field can accept an object of metadata that you want to attach to the subscriber.

<Note>
  To make all of your app users subscribers, you need to programmatically add
  them to Novu.
</Note>

## Trigger A Notification

Copy and paste the following code into your app to trigger a notification:

```ruby
require 'novu'

client = Novu::Client.new('YOUR_NOVU_API_KEY')

# trigger a notification

trigger_payload = {
    'name' => 'Trigger1',
    'payload' => {
        'first-name' => 'Adam'
    },
    'to' => {
        'subscriberId' => '7789'
    }
}
client.trigger_event(trigger_payload)

```

Before running the code, make sure you understand the following:

- The value ofÂ `name`Â should be the workflowâ€™s trigger ID/slug.

  <Frame caption="Make sure your workflow's trigger ID/slug matches the value you'd used">
    <img src="/images/template-nodejs.png" />{" "}
  </Frame>

- The value ofÂ `payload`Â is an array of the data that you want to be dynamically injected into the workflow content.
- The value ofÂ `subscriberId`Â is the id of the subscriber on Novu. ReplaceÂ `7789`Â with your subscriber ID.

Run the code to trigger a notification!

```bash
ruby index.rb

```

Next, weâ€™ll learn how to send notifications to different groups of subscribers easily viaÂ **Topics.**

## Topics

Novu provides a simple API that offers an easy interface for triggering notifications to multiple subscribers at once. This API is calledÂ **Topics**Â and allows users to manage their bulk notifications without having to implement complex loops.

A topic is identified by a custom key and this key will be the identifier used when triggering notifications. You can assign a name to a topic for descriptive purposes. This name does not need to be unique and can be changed programmatically.

<Note>
  The topic key should be unique and can't be changed once chosen. Novu also
  safeguards for key uniqueness behind the scenes.
</Note>

A topic can have multiple subscribers who will receive a notification whenever a message is sent to the topic.

### Create a Topic

Copy and paste the following code into your app to create a topic:

```ruby
require 'novu'

client = Novu::Client.new('YOUR_NOVU_API_KEY')
## Create a Topic

create_topic_payload = {
    'key'  => 'frontend-users',
    'name' => 'All frontend users'
}
client.create_topic(create_topic_payload)

```

Before running the code, make sure you understand the following:

- When creating aÂ `key`, ensure it is unique and accurately identifies the topic. Document naming conventions and communicate them to team members to avoid confusion and ensure a smooth workflow.
- The value ofÂ `name`Â should be a descriptive topic name.

### Add and Remove Subscribers to a Topic

Copy and paste the following code into your app to add subscribers to a topic:

```ruby
require 'novu'

client = Novu::Client.new('YOUR_NOVU_API_KEY')

topicKey = 'frontend-users'
subscribers = ['6460925ce1a93324257d2fc1', '7789'].to_s

## Add subscribers to a topic
client.add_subscribers(topicKey, subscribers)

```

Also, you can remove subscribers from a topic by using the code snippet below:

```ruby
require 'novu'

client = Novu::Client.new('YOUR_NOVU_API_KEY')

topicKey = 'frontend-users'
subscribers = ['6460925ce1a93324257d2fc1', '7789'].to_s

## Remove subscribers from a topic
client.remove_subscribers(topicKey, subscribers)

```

### Sending a notification to a Topic

Thanks to the topics feature, it is possible to trigger a notification to all subscribers assigned to a topic. This helps avoid listing all subscriber identifiers in theÂ `to`Â field of the notification trigger.

To trigger a notification to all subscribers of a topic, copy and paste the code below:

```ruby
require 'novu'

client = Novu::Client.new('YOUR_NOVU_API_KEY')

# Send notifications to a topic (all frontend users)
client.trigger_event({
    'name' => 'Trigger1',
    'to' => {
        'type' => 'Topic',
        'topicKey' => 'frontend-users'
    }
})

```

<Note>
  The value of theÂ `name`Â key in the payload should be the name of the
  notification created earlier.
</Note>

## Conclusion

Great job! If you've reached this point, you should now have successfully created a subscriber, workflow, configured a channel provider and triggered a notification in your application.
