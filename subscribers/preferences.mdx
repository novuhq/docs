Novu provides a way to store user preferences in the subscribers data model.
This allows subscribers to specify and manage their preferences, without your intervention. Customizing preferences has become the standard expected behavior for people and Novu can take the technical burden of managing preferences off of you.

**Novu allows two levels of preferences:**

- Workflow level channel preferences
- Subscriber level channel preferences

## Workflow level channel preferences

When creating a new workflow on the Web platform, you can specify default preferences for the subscribers in channel settings. They will be used unless the subscriber overrides them by his own custom preference.

This will allow you to create sensible defaults but still provide the user with the ability to override them. Template level preference can be managed in channel settings. All channels are `ON` unless specified otherwise.

## Subscriber level channel preferences

Our notification center component will show a user the available preferences, user will be able to modify on the channel level. Critical workflows will be excluded from the list. Click on cog (setting) icon on notification center component to open subscriber channel preferences page.

<Note>
  Only channels with a matched step will be returned from the API in
  notification center preference page. In case no channel content was found, the
  API will return an empty array.
</Note>

## Exclude workflows from preferences (critical workflow)

In some cases, you don't want the subscriber to be able to unsubscribe from mandatory notifications such as Account Verification, Password Reset, etc...

In those cases you can turn off the toggle `Users will be able to manage subscriptions` in channel settings. Workflow will become `critical`, once this toggle is turned `OFF`. By default, every workflow is `non-critical` and subscribers can manage channel preferences irrespective of workflow-level channel preferences. Critical workflow will not show on the subscriber preferences page.

```javascript
import { Novu } from "@novu/node";

const novu = new Novu("<NOVU_API_KEY>");

// 111 is subscriberId
await novu.subscribers.getPreference("111");
```

  </Tab>
    <Tab title="PHP">

$novu = new Novu('<NOVU_API_KEY>');

// 111 is subscriberId
$novu->getSubscriberPreferences('111')->toArray();
```

## Update subscriber preference for a workflow

<Tabs>

  <Tab title="Node.js">

```javascript
import { Novu, ChannelTypeEnum } from "@novu/node";

const novu = new Novu("<NOVU_API_KEY>");

// enable in_app channel
await novu.subscribers.updatePreference("subscriberId", "workflowIdentifier", {
  enabled: true,
  channel: { type: ChannelTypeEnum.IN_APP, enabled: true },
});

// enable email channel
await novu.subscribers.updatePreference("subscriberId", "workflowIdentifier", {
  enabled: true,
  channel: { type: ChannelTypeEnum.EMAIL, enabled: true },
});
```

  </Tab>
    <Tab title="PHP">

```php
use Novu\SDK\Novu;

$novu = new Novu('<NOVU_API_KEY>');

// enable in_app channel
$novu->updateSubscriberPreference('subscriberId', 'workflowIdentfier', [
    'enabled' => true
    'channel' => [
      'type' => 'in_app',
      'enabled' => true
    ]
]);

// enable email channel
$novu->updateSubscriberPreference('subscriberId', 'workflowIdentfier', [
    'enabled' => true
    'channel' => [
      'type' => 'email',
      'enabled' => true
    ]
]);
```

  </Tab>

## Order of priority of preferences

1. if `Users will be able to manage subscriptions` toggle is turned off i.e workflow is critical, this will override workflow level and subscriber level preferences and notification will always be sent.
2. if workflow is non critical and subscriber has `false` value set for `enabled` field in preference then all other channels will become inactive even if they have `true` state.
3. if workflow is non critical and subscriber has `true` value set for `enabled` field in preference then notification will be filtered based on subscriber channel preference.
4. Workflow level channel preferences will be applied to all subscribers by default unless subscriber overrides them.

`Example`

1. For `First Workflow`, `critical` is false, `enabled` is true, in_app, email, push channels are true and sms, chat channels are false. As per above order of priority of preferences, notification will be filtered as per the subscriber preferences. The subscriber will receive in-app, email and push notifications, but not receive sms and chat notifications.

2. For `Second Workflow`, `critical` is false, `enabled` is false, all channels are true. As per above order of priority of preferences, subscriber will not receive any type of notification because all channels become disabled due to false value of `enabled` field.

3. For `Third Workflow`. `critical` is true, `enabled` is false, email, chat channels are false and the other three channels are true. As per above order of priority of preferences, subscriber will receive all type of notifications as this workflow is `critical`.
